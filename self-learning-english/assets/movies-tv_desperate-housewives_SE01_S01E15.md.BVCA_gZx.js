You and me, no future.</p><p>Once some things are said...</p><p>Remember what it’s like to work a 60-hour week?</p><p>...You can’t take them back.</p><p>No one cares as much about finding Deidre as I do.</p><p>You shot yourself? Pretty lame, huh?</p><p>The damage is already done.</p><p>Mom!</p><p>You’re not taking her away from me. Get out.</p><p>I needed you to see something.</p><p>They said they stole it from Mike’s garage.</p><p>Is that blood?</p><p>Bree Van de kamp believed in old-fashioned values.</p><p>Things like respect for god,the importance of family,and love of country.</p><p>In fact, Bree believed so strongly in her values,it was always a shock whenever she was confrontedwith those who didn’t.</p><p>It’s not mine. You promised the cheating had stopped.</p><p>Rex, You promised.</p><p>Could we not yell at each other? I’m feeling really lousy today.</p><p>I want you out of the house.</p><p>Bree, look at me. It’s not mine.</p><p>Well then, whose is it?</p><p>It didn’t just magically appear in my laundry basket.</p><p>I’m not the only guy in this housethat uses that hamper.</p><p>No! Sorry.</p><p>Andrew’s still a child.</p><p>He’s 16. It’s not unheard of.</p><p>Honey, you have to talk to him. And tell him what?</p><p>Tell him that we found his condom and thathe is forbidden from... You know.</p><p>I can absolutely tell him that we think he’s too young,but I don’t think it’s gonna do any good.</p><p>Well, then, the least we can do is to search his room,and if we find any more of these, we’ll confiscate them.</p><p>That will accomplish what?</p><p>Do you want to become a grandmother?</p><p>Yes, Bree believed in old-fashioned values.</p><p>But she also believedit was better to be safe than sorry.</p><p>Each new morning in suburbia brings with ita new set of lies.</p><p>Little white lies, told not to hurt...</p><p>Morning, Mrs. Petchul, you look lovely today.</p><p>...But to make life more pleasant.</p><p>They tell these lies to protect themselvesand their reputations.</p><p>Oh, for god’s sake, this is unbelievable.</p><p>This is the last time I do my banking online.</p><p>Of course, every now and then,the day arrives when someonefinally decides to tell the truth.</p><p>He was shot? How could you not tell us about this?</p><p>He was embarrassed. He said it was an accident.</p><p>Oh, don’t look at me like that. Accidents happen.</p><p>We know you want to trust Mike,But he had a dead woman’s jewelry in his garage.</p><p>Now did he? We don’t know that for sure.</p><p>All we know isthat Lynette’s kids turned up with it.</p><p>So what are you saying, that the twins murdered Martha?</p><p>Well, I wouldn’t put it past them.</p><p>I’m saying that is about as likely as Mike having done it.</p><p>He’s a good guy. I know him.</p><p>I mean, he’s... He’s mike.</p><p>Honestly, I don’t think Mike did it either,But if we don’t call, we’re guilty of withholding evidence.</p><p>Well, you know what? If he is innocent, this shouldbe a simple matter to clear up.</p><p>But... we will do whatever you want us to do.</p><p>Ok, call.</p><p>Shall I just dial 911?</p><p>It’s not really an emergency.</p><p>There was a murder.</p><p>Well, not recently. And I prefer not to tie up the line.</p><p>Will you just call?</p><p>My mom will be home any minute.</p><p>She’ll freak if she sees you here.</p><p>Oh, I just wanted to deliver this personally.</p><p>I’m having a party.</p><p>You know she doesn’t want us to see each other.</p><p>Well, you gotta come. I... You’re the reason I’m doing this.</p><p>I’ll try to talk to my mom, ok?</p><p>But you really gotta go.</p><p>Hey, Mrs. Solis. I’m sorry. Do I know you?</p><p>Yeah, I’m Justin, John’s roommate.</p><p>I’ve been waiting forever for you to show up.</p><p>Really? Why? I want to do you a favor.</p><p>What kind of favor?</p><p>John says that you can’t exactly afford a gardener right now,and I told him I’d be happy to do it. For free.</p><p>You want to mow my lawn for free?</p><p>Mow your lawn. Water your flowers. Trim your bushes.</p><p>I could do everything John did for you.</p><p>That’s very generous of you, but I don’t think so.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Because my husband is home quite a lot these days.</p><p>If any bush needs trimming, he takes care of it.</p><p>This is a beautiful yard.</p><p>I’m sure it could use a little extra attention.</p><p>I’m flattered, but no, thank you.</p><p>Mrs. Solis, please.</p><p>Did I mention why my husband’s home a lot?</p><p>He’s under house arrest.</p><p>He has a lot of anger toward the government right now,and he’s just dying to find someone to take it out on.</p><p>Hey, guys. This isn’t a hockey rink.</p><p>Can you take it outside?</p><p>Hi, honey. How was your day?</p><p>I didn’t get the V.P. gig.</p><p>Oh, Tom, I am so sorry.</p><p>It doesn’t make sense to me.</p><p>I’m Peterson’s ”go-to guy”.</p><p>So how does Tim Duggan, the biggest blowhard in the office,get promoted to vice president over me?</p><p>I thought you liked Tim Duggan?</p><p>I do. I just... I don’t know, I just,I really wanted that promotion.</p><p>Hey, boys, can you please take the Stanley Cup finals outside.</p><p>Did you tell Mr. Peterson that you wanted the job?</p><p>I have worked at that firm for 8 1/2 years.</p><p>Duggan’s been there for less than two. I am not gonna beg.</p><p>I’m not saying to beg.</p><p>You just have to step up from time to time.</p><p>You have to see your opportunity and take it.</p><p>Nobody respects a shrinking violet.</p><p>There is more than one, you know, leadership style.</p><p>Mine is quiet but... Effective.</p><p>Take that racket outside!</p><p>Whatever works for you.</p><p>Susan!</p><p>Hey, sexy. Where you been?</p><p>I called you twice. You avoiding me?</p><p>Don’t be silly. Why would I do that?</p><p>No, I’ve been really busy grocery shopping.</p><p>For two days? You must be pretty well stocked.</p><p>How about dinner tonight?</p><p>Dinner... Tonight? Um...</p><p>You ok?</p><p>Can you hold these a sec?</p><p>Up against the car!</p><p>You have the right to remain silent.</p><p>Anything you do say can be usedagainst you in a court of law.</p><p>You have the right to consult an attorney...</p><p>So get this.</p><p>Zach Young’s throwing a pool party saturday night.</p><p>He sent out a bunch formal invitations.Complete with fancy lettering.</p><p>I’m surprised he didn’t spritz them with aftershave.</p><p>What is wrong with nice invitations?</p><p>Mom, it’s a pool party.</p><p>Why couldn’t he have just passed out flyers in the quad.</p><p>’Cause he’s genetically incapable of being cool.</p><p>So, uh... Are you going?</p><p>Uh... Maybe.</p><p>I mean, um, Lisa and Justin and some of the guysthought it’d be fun to swim.</p><p>We can always bail if it’s lame as we think it’s going to be..</p><p>Oh, is, um, Lisa your friend with the pierced navel?</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>You’ve been spending a lot of time together lately. Haven’t you?</p><p>I guess.</p><p>Oh, uh, Andrew, I’m gonna want you home by 11 on saturday.</p><p>11? Mom, it’s not even a school night!</p><p>Bree, a curfew isn’t gonna do any good.</p><p>You may be able to abdicateall your parental responsibility,But I cannot.</p><p>What... What’s going on here?</p><p>Was this have to do with the condom you left in my room?</p><p>As a matter of fact, it does. And just so we’re clear,if you get Lisa pregnant, you will marry her.</p><p>Andrew, this is not funny.</p><p>Mom, trust me. This is very funny.</p><p>Mostly because the condom wasn’t mine.</p><p>You suck, you know that?</p><p>So obviously we need to talk.</p><p>I’m still a virgin, if that’s what you want to know.</p><p>Well, good.</p><p>But why on earth would you need a condom?</p><p>Because I’m planning on having sex and not want to get pregnant.</p><p>Danielle, you are president of the abstinence club.</p><p>I wasn’t planning on running for a second term.</p><p>Who were you planning on having sex with?</p><p>John.</p><p>John Rowland. I thought you broke up with him.</p><p>No. He broke up with me.</p><p>You want to know why, because I wouldn’t do it.</p><p>If that’s the type of boy he is, then good riddance.</p><p>Mom, every boy at my school is that type of boy.</p><p>And besides, it’s different with John.</p><p>I love him.</p><p>Sweetheart, just because you give a boy sexdoesn’t mean you’ll get love in return.</p><p>So maybe I’m being stupid.</p><p>What’s the big deal? It’s just sex.</p><p>I am looking over for your happiness.</p><p>I understand what it’s like to be young and feel urges.</p><p>But I waited until I got married. As did your father.</p><p>And it was so much better.</p><p>But daddy ended up cheating on you.</p><p>Yes. Well...</p><p>And ever since he moved back, you’ve been miserable.</p><p>Why would you say that?</p><p>The walls between our bedrooms are paper thin.</p><p>I hear more stuff than I probably should.</p><p>Look, mom, I love you a lot,But you really are the last person everto give anyone advice about sex and happiness.</p><p>Have you seen these? Five more past due notices.</p><p>Don’t worry, I’m handling it.</p><p>How are you handling it?</p><p>Can I please finish my sandwich?</p><p>Have you seen our account? We’re broke.</p><p>We have the mortgage payment coming up...</p><p>we have property taxes, we have...</p><p>Gaby, it’s gonna be ok.</p><p>No, it’s not. We are seriously screwed.</p><p>And I am freaking out that you’re not freaking out.</p><p>Look, things will turn around. When?</p><p>I don’t know when.</p><p>But we’re lucky people. And we’ll be lucky again.</p><p>What is that? It’s the lawn mower.</p><p>We got a new gardener today.</p><p>It won’t cost us a cent. The kid’s a friend of John’s.</p><p>Carlos... And he said he’d do the lawn for free.</p><p>Can you believe it? We are lucky people.</p><p>Hey, guys, good to see you again.</p><p>Don’t look so glum. You’ll get a hit.</p><p>Oh, it’s not that.</p><p>This is my ”hating Tim Duggan” look.</p><p>Oh, Duggan connects.</p><p>There!</p><p>Look at that job-stealing bastard run.</p><p>Duggan is really showing some of that glory-hounding,Ass-kissing hustle that he is so well-known for.</p><p>I forgot how much fun you are when you’re bitter.</p><p>Look, he’s stretching for extra bases.</p><p>Just like he stretched for extra territory,screwing over unsung utility player, Tom Scavo.</p><p>Oh! Down goes Duggan.</p><p>Duggan goes down. That’s gotta hurt.</p><p>Oh, Lord! Hound is tagged out, and now he’s gonnahave to deal with some tough dirt stains, that Tim Duggan.</p><p>Tom...</p><p>No, I’m sure he’s just grandstanding.</p><p>Oh, my god!</p><p>Holy crap!</p><p>It’s only a pool party. Everyone is going to be there.</p><p>I said no.</p><p>What are you goning to do?</p><p>Keep a boy-free zone around me until I’m 18?</p><p>You can see boys, in a couple years, just not that boy.</p><p>Why do you hate Zach?</p><p>I don’t hate Zach. I just think he’s sort of crazy.</p><p>Mom, I’ve heard people call you ”sort of crazy”.</p><p>Well, I’m adorable crazy. And he’s rampage crazy.</p><p>Susan Mayer? Yeah?</p><p>I’m detective Copeland,investigating the murder of Martha Huber.</p><p>I need to talk to you about Mike Delfino.</p><p>Do you remember seeing Mr. Delfino on the 7th of last month?</p><p>Is the 7th important?</p><p>We believe it was the night that Martha Huber was murdered.</p><p>She was last seen at the grocery store at nine.</p><p>She didn’t show for a dentist appointment the next morning.</p><p>What day was that? It was a sunday.</p><p>Oh! Oh, my god! Yes!</p><p>Yes! yes!</p><p>Yes, I... I was with Mike that night.</p><p>You’re sure? Yes. I was.</p><p>It was a big night, first relationship-wise.</p><p>It was the first time that we...</p><p>The first time you...? Did it.</p><p>The first time they did it.</p><p>Julie! It was.</p><p>How did you know? I’m not clueless.</p><p>I found men’s boxers in the clothes hamper.</p><p>Don’t write that down.</p><p>This is good. You can let Mike go. He is innocent.</p><p>Assuming everything you’re telling me is true.</p><p>It’s true.</p><p>The next morning she made pancakes in the shape of little hearts.</p><p>Seriously, little hearts.</p><p>Oh, god!</p><p>Justin. What are you doing up here?</p><p>Uh... I finished the hedges.</p><p>Is there anything else Mr. Solis wants done?</p><p>I don’t know. He’s not here. He had a meeting with his lawyer.</p><p>So I guess that means we’re all alone.</p><p>No. That means I’m all alone. You’re leaving.</p><p>I’m not in a hurry.</p><p>Come on, we could hang out for a while.</p><p>I don’t think so.</p><p>Come on. If you just got to know me,you’d see I can be lots of fun.</p><p>All my friends say so.</p><p>I’m not interested in becoming one of your friends.</p><p>Get out of my bedroom.</p><p>Come on, mrs. Solis. Be nice.</p><p>You shouldn’t have done that.</p><p>Do you know how easy it would befor me to tell my husband what you tried to do?</p><p>Not as easy as it’d be for me to tell him about you and John.</p><p>I... I’m sorry, Mrs. Solis,but you’re gonna have to be nice to me,at least once.</p><p>Mike!</p><p>Mike! Are you ok?</p><p>Uh... Yeah. Yeah. I’m a little bit embarrassed.</p><p>Must be the talk of the neighborhood.</p><p>No. Not really. No.</p><p>So guess what? I’m your alibi.</p><p>I told the policethat we were together the night Mrs. Huber was killed.</p><p>And that I could never forget that night.</p><p>You don’t think I killed Mrs. Huber?</p><p>No! No, of course not.</p><p>I could never think you killed anybody,even if I wasn’t your alibi, which I am.</p><p>Ok. I’m, um, I’m gonna go take a shower.</p><p>Jail’s kinda gross.</p><p>I’ll call you later. Ok?</p><p>Sure. When?</p><p>Later. I just got some stuff I gotta take care of. Ok?</p><p>Ok.</p><p>Mrs. Van de kamp. Hello, John.</p><p>I’m sorry to drop by unannounced. Do you have a moment?</p><p>Sure.</p><p>So... What can I do for you?</p><p>Well, I tell you, my daughter is planning on giving you her virginityand I would consider it a personal favor if you wouldn’t take it.</p><p>So what’s the word on Tim?</p><p>He came through the triple bypass with flying colors.</p><p>Thank god.</p><p>It’s not all coming up roses.</p><p>He’s not gonna be able to come backto work for four-and-a-half months.</p><p>What?</p><p>Company still needs to expand,I figure that they need a fit, heart-smart guylike me to step up, take the ball.</p><p>You’re going after his promotion?</p><p>No. I already got it.</p><p>You should have seen me.</p><p>I walked straight into Peterson’s officeand told him he would be a fool to hold Duggan’s promotion.</p><p>You called your boss a fool? I did.</p><p>That was risky in retrospect.</p><p>But still he gave me the job.</p><p>Oh, my god. That’s great. Honey, it’s me.</p><p>I got the whole west coast.</p><p>Oh, my... What? What the whole west coast?</p><p>I thought you were going after an in-house position.</p><p>No. I’m setting up new offices fromSeattle to LA. I told you that.</p><p>No.</p><p>No, you didn’t.</p><p>Ok. Well, so it’s gonna be a little bit more travel, but...</p><p>More travel?</p><p>Tom, you’re barely here half the time as it is.</p><p>Now you’re gonna have, what, twice the workload?</p><p>Honey, please don’t ruin this.</p><p>You should have consulted with me.</p><p>I did! You told me to stop being a shrinking violet.</p><p>I thought this was an in-house position.</p><p>Ok, I’m gonna go shower.</p><p>Look, wait. Wait. I know what this means to you.</p><p>No, you don’t. No, you don’t.</p><p>I am 41 years old.</p><p>If I don’t make vice president now,it’s never gonna happen.</p><p>This is my career. It’s important to me.</p><p>So was mine. But I’m here, aren’t I?</p><p>I’m gonna take the job.</p><p>She said you broke up with herbecause she refused to have sex.</p><p>Wow! um... Ok, here’s the deal.</p><p>I said that. But it was just an excuse.</p><p>I mean, the truth is, I wasn’t that into her.</p><p>Really?</p><p>She was always so proud of never having done it,I figured, ”hey, this is my way out.”Well, she feels very passionately about you.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong. She’s nice.</p><p>But the truth is, there’s someone else.</p><p>Oh, are you going steady?</p><p>Not exactly. We were seeing each other pretty regularly,but this other lady... Girl, she sort of dumped me.</p><p>Oh, I see.</p><p>Look, I’ll talk to Danielleand don’t worry, I’ll let her down gently.</p><p>Um, actually, I would prefer if you didn’t.</p><p>I know my daughter. She’s very determined.</p><p>Unless you’re really firm with her,she’ll think there’s hope.</p><p>Ok. I’ll be firm.</p><p>Better still, be brutal.</p><p>Decided to indulge your sweet tooth?</p><p>I’ll be dead inside a year.</p><p>I’ve got bigger things to worry about than my waistline.</p><p>So, who’s the woman they think you killed?</p><p>Martha Huber. Local busybody.</p><p>I thought her murder was random.</p><p>Nothing random about her jewelry ending up in your garage.</p><p>Did you kill her?</p><p>No. Whoever set me up did a good job.</p><p>The cops are all over me.</p><p>You’re getting close to something.</p><p>If I am close, I don’t see it.</p><p>People leave trails.</p><p>One of those trails will lead to Deidre.</p><p>Whoever set you up must know that.</p><p>Maybe, but I won’t be much good to you locked up.</p><p>I’m rich, Mike. One of the best things about being richis the security of knowing you can buy your way out of any problem.</p><p>I’m not taking my money to the grave.</p><p>I’m gonna use it to save your ass.</p><p>Mrs. Solis? Hello, Justin.</p><p>What are you doing here?</p><p>I am here to talk to your roommate.</p><p>John? I didn’t think you guys talked any more.</p><p>Well, now we have something to talk about. You.</p><p>Me? Yes.</p><p>How you’re trying to blackmail me into sleeping with you.</p><p>I wonder how he’ll react. Mrs. Solis...</p><p>You think he’ll get violent?</p><p>You can’t talk to John about that. Oh, I can.</p><p>And I will, you little worthless piece of crap.</p><p>Listen, Mrs. Solis, I’m sorry.</p><p>I didn’t want to blackmail you.</p><p>Then why did you?</p><p>I really needed to sleep with you.</p><p>Why? Because...</p><p>I think I might be gay.</p><p>Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!</p><p>What’s up?</p><p>The boys knew you wouldn’t be home till after, um, bedtime,and so we decided to pop in and visit the new V.P.</p><p>Check it out. I finally got an office with a window. Huh?</p><p>Yeah. It’s all about the window.</p><p>Hey, guys. Hey, who wants chair rides?</p><p>Me! Me! Me! Out this way. Here we go.</p><p>Here we go, guys. Ready?</p><p>Hold on.</p><p>Checking out the new executive digs?</p><p>Oh, you know it.</p><p>Can I tell you a little secret? Sure.</p><p>Dan wanted to hold the promotion over for Tim Duggan.</p><p>And I’m the one that convinced him to give it To tom.</p><p>Really? Uh-huh.</p><p>Tom is such a workhorseand he wanted it so badly.</p><p>Yeah, he certainly did.</p><p>What is wrong? Aren’t you happy about this promotion?</p><p>Lynette realized it was best to lie to the boss’s wife...</p><p>Well, it’s great.</p><p>Obviously. Thank you.</p><p>...Provided she wasn’t too convincing.</p><p>Of course, I mean,I will... miss him being gone all the time.</p><p>He’ll be bringing in more money,but he is gonna miss the birthdays,baseball games, first steps.</p><p>But that’s the trade-off. Right?</p><p>I just hope one day Tom doesn’t look backand regret being gone so much.</p><p>Oh, I better get out there before they break something.</p><p>Of course. I will see you soon. Ok.</p><p>So, have you been acting on these feelings?</p><p>I got a buddy. We get together.</p><p>Mess around. But it’s no big deal.</p><p>It’s just lately, I’ve been starting to care about him and...</p><p>and I don’t know how to handle it.</p><p>And I thought if I sleep with somebody like you,I’ll know for sure and I can stop freaking out about this.</p><p>But why me? You’re a good-looking kid.</p><p>Why not test drive someone your own age?</p><p>Girls talk. If I start something with somebodyand it doesn’t... work out,Everyone at school will find out.</p><p>And I figured I can trust you,cause you have a husband and all.</p><p>Well, I guess that makes sense in a weird sort of way.</p><p>You know, my buddy and I have beenmessing around for quite a while,and this whole time I kept telling myselfthat it didn’t really mean anything, you know?</p><p>Guess I’ve been kidding myself, huh?</p><p>We’re all in denial about something.</p><p>But you’re finally facing the truth,and I think that’s sort of brave.</p><p>Thanks. I should probably go.</p><p>Uh... Just so you know,I never would have told Mr. Solis about you and John.</p><p>I may be gay but I’m not a jerk.</p><p>Did you feel anything?</p><p>Not really.</p><p>You’re definitely gay.</p><p>Hi. I’m sorry to bother you at night,but I was hoping that you could come to the stationto answer more questions.</p><p>Now? Well, I’m sorry,my daughter and I were gonna go see a movie tonight.</p><p>Mom? We can do it another night. I’ll be fine.</p><p>Uh, let me get my purse. Great.</p><p>Are you sure? Yeah.</p><p>I won’t be late.</p><p>Bye. Bye.</p><p>You said that Mike came to your housearound 10 p.m. on the night of the seventh.</p><p>Um, am I supposed to talk into the camera or...</p><p>No. Just talk to me.</p><p>Ok. Uh, yes. He came over around ten o’clock.</p><p>Do you know of any tension, uh,between Mike and Martha Huber?</p><p>No.</p><p>Were you aware Mike was shot recently?</p><p>Yes, on Valentine’s Day.</p><p>Do you know how that came about?</p><p>He dropped his gun, cleaning it.</p><p>Ms Mayer, I’ve been around guns for years.</p><p>I’ve never seen one discharge when it hits the ground.</p><p>Someone has to pull the trigger.</p><p>I wouldn’t know about that.</p><p>Were you aware there was a home invasionon Pine Avenue the day before Valentine’s?</p><p>No.</p><p>The intruder was shot in the stomach.</p><p>Where was Mike’s wound?</p><p>The stomach.</p><p>Do you love him?</p><p>What?</p><p>What does that have to do with...?</p><p>Sometimes people do stupid things when they’re in love.</p><p>I should know. I’ve been married four times.</p><p>Tell me the truth. He wasn’t with you that night.</p><p>He asked you to lie for him. No, he didn’t.</p><p>He was with me. And Mike wouldn’t kill anybody.</p><p>I’m sure of that.</p><p>Mike Delfino, convicted 1987,did five-and-a-half yearsfor drug trafficing and manslaughter.</p><p>You want a coffe? I’m gonna go for a coffe.</p><p>Is she covering for her guy?</p><p>No. She’s just a sucker.</p><p>I guess no one’s in the pool yet. Are you gonna swim?</p><p>Please, I just spent an hour blowing out my hair.</p><p>Good luck, man.</p><p>I’ll... I’ll see you later.

Didn’t think he’d come.</p><p>Yeah, he brought his friends.</p><p>They’re acting like total jerks. Alert the media.</p><p>I don’t care. You’re here now. This is gonna be great.</p><p>Come on, man. Let’s go.</p><p>Danielle! Don’t touch me!</p><p>Hope you can swim.</p><p>Can you possibly take it easy? It’s cool, man.</p><p>Look, he floats.</p><p>All right? Relax. It’s a party.</p><p>You’re the main party animal, right?</p><p>Am I right?</p><p>I guess.</p><p>All right! Well, then act like it.</p><p>Come on, give me a howl.</p><p>Come on. You’re the host. Revel in it. Gimme a howl.</p><p>There you go.</p><p>You ok?</p><p>What do I care?
