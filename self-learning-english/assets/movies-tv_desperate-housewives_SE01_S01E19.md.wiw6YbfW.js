It’ll be great!</p><p>I’ll say I’m 42 and you can be 28.</p><p>What?!</p><p>Oh! You can pull it off!</p><p>Mrs. Mccluskey,you’re back from hospital already?</p><p>Turns out I OD’d a little bit on my arthritis medication.</p><p>One pill, I can open a jar.</p><p>Four pills, I’m face-down crawling for my life.</p><p>You’ll find out about that soon enough.</p><p>Well, I’m glad to hear you’re all right.</p><p>Here, my way of saying thank you for notletting me die out there on the lawn.</p><p>Oh, Mrs. Mccluskey, you don’t...</p><p>Keep that.</p><p>It’s genuine Tiffany.

Why not?!</p><p>Because it’s the one way I can ensureyou’ll be here when I get out of jail.</p><p>Well, then have fun at the motel.</p><p>Fine. Tomorrow I’m canceling your credit cards.</p><p>What?</p><p>And I’m taking away your ATM as well.</p><p>What am I supposed to do for money?</p><p>Maybe once you see how good you’ve got it,you’ll treat me with a little respect.</p><p>You want my respect? Then tear up the post-nup.</p><p>Give me my pillow.</p><p>One more thing...</p><p>if you ever hurt me again, I will kill you.</p><p>If you ever leave me for another man, I’ll kill you.</p><p>Boy, with all this passion,isn’t it a shame we’re not having sex?</p><p>I feel trapped.</p><p>Want me to open a window?</p><p>No, I’m talking about my life.</p><p>Are we done making out?</p><p>No, no, keep going.</p><p>So what’s up?</p><p>I’m unhappy. With Carlos and my marriage...</p><p>I feel like I don’t have options, it’s driving me crazy.</p><p>Every time something went south in my life,I always had a plan b.</p><p>Now, I feel like I have nothing.</p><p>What about me? Can’t I be your plan b?</p><p>Damn it, John. What is our new rule?</p><p>Stop pretending we have a future.</p><p>Thank you. Can’t you just walk out?</p><p>No. If I leave,then I’ll be broke and that’s awful.</p><p>If I stay, he’s in control and that’s horrifying.</p><p>And he cut up all my credit cards,which means I’m married to him and unable to shop.</p><p>Which is probably the worst of all possible worlds.</p><p>I’m sorry. I’ll figure something out.</p><p>I’m not much fun today. I’m gonna go.</p><p>Wait.</p><p>What’s this? You deserve nice things.</p><p>And if Mr. Solis won’t provide them, I will.</p><p>With your student credit card?</p><p>I own my own business.</p><p>You mow lawns. I make good money.</p><p>I’ve 20 houses andI’m this close to getting the country club.</p><p>I can’t. Yes, you can.</p><p>I’ll pay it off.</p><p>If you want. But you don’t have to.</p><p>Mrs. Solis... To take care of you...</p><p>...it’s my dream.</p><p>Well, far be it from me to stand in the wayof a young man’s dream.</p><p>Ok, Tom, I will swing by the dry-cleaners’after I hit the market.</p><p>I don’t know. Porter has a dentist appointment at 4 pm.</p><p>So the car might have to wait until tomorrow.</p><p>Ok, yeah, I love you too.</p><p>Bye-bye. Hi, there.</p><p>I brought you some avocados.</p><p>I’ve a tree but I hate ’em.</p><p>Your family seems like the kind that would eat guacamole.</p><p>Oh, Mrs. Mccluskey, thank you. That is very nice.</p><p>So let’s make up a batch.</p><p>Oh, um... Now’s not a good time.</p><p>I’m on my way out, I have a ton of errands.</p><p>That’s great, because my car’s on the fritzand I could hitch a ride. I need to drop by the pharmacy.</p><p>No, I can’t.</p><p>I’m sorry, but I have a lot of things to do.</p><p>Maybe you could take me later. I could drop by tomorrow.</p><p>Mrs. Mccluskey, I’m not gonna have any time tomorrow.</p><p>Interesting you can’t spend two minutes with mebut you have no trouble taking my Tiffany lamp.</p><p>Oh, for god’s sakes!</p><p>Here. You should take this back. I...</p><p>I don’t have a place for it.</p><p>That was my thank you for saving my life.</p><p>I know, and it was a beautiful gesture, really.</p><p>But I just...</p><p>Save it, Lynette.</p><p>I get the picture.</p><p>Oh, god!</p><p>Susie, this is Tim.</p><p>Sorry if we startled you.</p><p>Oh, uh... That’s ok, I...</p><p>I just didn’t expect to see anybody up at a quarter to one.</p><p>Oh, Susie, you should have come out tonight.</p><p>I met Tim here at the Islands Barand he introduced me to this crazy drink.</p><p>The dirty volcano!</p><p>It’s...</p><p>Then we danced...</p><p>He dipped me.</p><p>Sophie’s very... limber.</p><p>Uh, mom, could I just talk to youin the family room for a minute?</p><p>Oh, sure. Susan is your daughter?</p><p>Yup. No, she can’t be!</p><p>Yes! No!</p><p>Yeah! No!</p><p>Yeah! No!</p><p>Yes... Ok, we get it.</p><p>She looks young.</p><p>Oh, that man has magic fingers.</p><p>What are you doing?! I have a teenage daughter in the house.</p><p>You can’t bring men you meet in barshere in the middle of the night!</p><p>We’re just having a few laughs. What’s the big deal?</p><p>I know you’re trying to get over Mortybut this is not the way to do it.</p><p>Just go out there and tell him to go home.</p><p>You know how blue I’ve been. Why can’t you be supportive?</p><p>I’ve been plenty supportive.</p><p>You haven’t. You really haven’t.</p><p>Now, Tim is my guest and he will go home when I say so.</p><p>If he’s not gone in five minutes,I’m gonna go out there and tell him how old you really are.</p><p>Tim, it’s time for me to go sleepy-bye.</p><p>Delfino.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>You must be Sullivan.</p><p>The file on Noah’s daughter.</p><p>Yeah, he said you had some leads.</p><p>Yeah, sure, we got some leads.</p><p>Is there a problem? Gee, I don’t know.</p><p>I’m handing a confidential police reportover to a killer and drug-dealer.</p><p>Why should that be a problem?</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>Is this what our justice system has come to?</p><p>Guys like you walking the streetswithout a care in the world?</p><p>I did my time.</p><p>Not nearly enough, you piece of garbage.</p><p>I’m glad we had the chance to meet.</p><p>Because apparently I’m no longera murder suspect, thanks to you.</p><p>I don’t want to seem ungrateful,But just out of curiosity,how much does it cost to buy offa homicide detective these days?</p><p>Thanks again.</p><p>Hey, Delfino. One more thing.</p><p>Now this file was misplaced...</p><p>...Understand?</p><p>If even a whisper of this gets traced back to me,there will be one less cop-killer on the street.</p><p>And for god’s sakes, don’t get any blood on the file.</p><p>Ma’am, I’m sorry, but your credit card has been declined.</p><p>What?</p><p>Oh, no, that’s impossible. It’s a new card.</p><p>I just went shopping with it. Try it again.</p><p>Ma’am, I ran it three times and then I called the bank.</p><p>May I try another card?</p><p>Of course you may. Will you just give me a moment?</p><p>Hello? It’s me.</p><p>I’ve been trying to call you, but you turned your cell off.</p><p>Because I’m in a lovely restaurant having a lovely mealthat I can’t pay for.</p><p>Well, did you order already? I ate already.</p><p>Look, the credit card company called my mom.</p><p>I mean, they said there was unusual activity on my card.</p><p>I bought shoes! Well, I didn’t know that.</p><p>And then my mom started asking all these questionsso I just blurted out it was stolen and she canceled it.</p><p>Why would they call your parents? It’s your account.</p><p>They co-sign for it.</p><p>Look, if you just explain to the waiter...</p><p>What?! My card was canceled by my lover’s mommy?</p><p>What other options do you have?</p><p>Unless you return the shoes and get the money back?</p><p>Return the shoes?!</p><p>I can’t talk to you when you’re being hysterical.</p><p>So, ma’am, what would you like to do about the bill?</p><p>Afternoon, I’ve got a packagefor your neighbor, Karen Mccluskey.</p><p>Mind signing?</p><p>Well, isn’t she home? She usually never goes anywhere.</p><p>No one answered.</p><p>All right.</p><p>Ok.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>So let me get this straight.</p><p>You play tennis, you know wine,and you speak Mandarin.</p><p>Does every other man in the world want you dead?</p><p>I’m not that impressive.</p><p>I pulled a gray hair out of my chest this morning.</p><p>I don’t know, I’d watch your back.</p><p>You know, I’ve really enjoyed talking to you.</p><p>You, uh...</p><p>Well, you’ve made my day.</p><p>I was thinking, if you’d like to get together again...</p><p>Well, Sam, to tell you the truth,I’m kind of in a relationship right now.</p><p>I just wanted to be honest. That’s perfectly ok, Tina.</p><p>By the way, this is on me.</p><p>Oh, no, you shouldn’t. Oh, please.</p><p>It’s my pleasure.</p><p>This is gonna be a disaster. It’ll be fine.</p><p>Andrew! Honey, hurry up, dinner’s ready!</p><p>It’s like we’re setting a trap for him.</p><p>It’s for his own good. You’ll see.</p><p>Smells good. What are we having?</p><p>I’m making home-made bratwurst with sweet and sour cabbage.</p><p>It’s a recipe I found in an old german cookbook.</p><p>I’ll get the door. Honey, why don’t you pour the wine?</p><p>Isn’t Danielle spending the night at Wendy’s? I believe she is.</p><p>Well, then, why did mom set the table for four places?</p><p>I asked, who’s coming for dinner?</p><p>Andrew, you remember reverend Sikes, don’t you?</p><p>Oh, come on.</p><p>Reverend, why don’t you have a seat and I will get some refreshments.</p><p>So... Andrew... It’s been a long time.</p><p>Yes. Yes, it has.</p><p>Would you like some water? I have flat or bubbly?</p><p>Oh, bubbly, please.</p><p>So...</p><p>Your mother tells meyou’ve started having some sexual desires for other boys.</p><p>I don’t suppose I could get some of that?</p><p>No. I’m gonna need every drop.</p><p>And over the years, we’ve had so many young people come to our ministryhating themselves for their unnatural desires.</p><p>And witnin a few months, they’ve found an inner peace and tranquility.</p><p>That is nothing short of miraculous.</p><p>All it takes is a little faith and a desire to change.</p><p>I’m sorry, but I really don’t want to talk about my sex life.</p><p>Well, that’s too bad, this needs to be discussed.</p><p>Bree, please, let the boy speak.</p><p>Go on.</p><p>Well, I appreciate your offer to help, I do. But...</p><p>I don’t hate myself.</p><p>So... I’m good.</p><p>Son, I know what it’s like to be a teenager.</p><p>It’s a very confusing time.</p><p>I’m not confused.</p><p>I... I know exactly who I am.</p><p>Well...</p><p>If you ever do want to talk, my door is always open.</p><p>Reverend, I don’t mean to criticize but...</p><p>...It sounds like you’re giving up.</p><p>We can’t force him on a path of righteousness.</p><p>He himself has got to want to make the journey.</p><p>What do we do? Just stand by while he starts dating boys?</p><p>And by the way, the correct word is not ”gay”, it’s ”sodomy”.</p><p>We’re in the middle of dinner. So?</p><p>Can you wait till dessert to call our son a sodomite?</p><p>How you can seat there and be so casual is beyond me.</p><p>For starters, I knew this dinner was a bad ideathe moment you suggested it.</p><p>At least I’m trying to be proactive.</p><p>Please, no need to get upset.</p><p>I’m upset because there’s a problem no one seems to notice but me.</p><p>As far as I’m concerned, if Andrew is happy with who he is,it is our job to support him.</p><p>Your father is into S&amp; M. Bree!</p><p>He makes me beat him with a riding crop. I let him.</p><p>No wonder you’re perverted. Look who your parents are.</p><p>Excuse me.</p><p>What a fun night.</p><p>You know, we should probably do this again sometime.</p><p>Hey, good news!</p><p>I know why you’ve been so furious at me.</p><p>I haven’t been furious at you. Yes, you have.</p><p>And I don’t blame you.</p><p>Men have been coming onto me left and right.</p><p>And I’ve been having so much fun and just enjoying life.</p><p>And what do I do? I throw it right in your face.</p><p>I’d hate me too. Mom, I don’t hate you.</p><p>Well, be that as it may,from here on out, I’m including you in all the fun.</p><p>The fun. Mm-hm. Your mother’s come through.</p><p>What have you done?</p><p>You and I are going on a double date tonight.</p><p>What?! Tim has a friend from the factory.</p><p>I thought the four of us could hang out,have drinks, hors d’oeuvres...</p><p>Forget it. Susie!</p><p>Mom, I’m sorry, I’m just not in the mood to hang out these days.</p><p>Susie, sweetie, please.</p><p>I can’t cancel now.</p><p>Of course you can. Just call them up and tell them not to come over.</p><p>Tim. Hi, Suz. This is my buddy, Lamont.</p><p>I brought peppermint schnapps.</p><p>I’m sure she’s fine.</p><p>She never leaves her mail sitting out there.</p><p>I mean, how many times has she thrown ours awaybecause we didn’t pick it up the second it came?</p><p>That would be five.</p><p>I don’t know, Tom, I think something’s happened to her.</p><p>Ok, so go check on her.</p><p>But if I’m wrong,I’m sucked intoa two-hour conversation about bunions.</p><p>Don’t go check. Six months from now,when they find her mummified corpse at the bottom of the basement stairs,What do I tell the kids?</p><p>”Oh, yeah, I let Mrs. Mccluskey die.”Why would they care?</p><p>Like they’ll miss the dry-cleaningcoupons she hands out on Halloween.</p><p>Tom! Listen, honey, what can I say?</p><p>You’re damned if you do and damned if you don’t, so...</p><p>I don’t know. Good luck with that.</p><p>Honey, I’m hating you a little bit right now.</p><p>Hi, honey! Look at my new shoes.</p><p>Aren’t they gorgeous?</p><p>Honey, I’m trying to watch the game.</p><p>Sorry.</p><p>How’d you buy new shoes?</p><p>Shh! talk later, you’re watching the game.</p><p>No, I wanna talk about it now.</p><p>You have no money, what’s the story?</p><p>Oh, you’ve heard it before.</p><p>Girl meets boy, boy buys girl things,girl leaves happy.</p><p>What did you do?</p><p>I forgot how generous men could be.</p><p>I also forgot I have options. A whole bunch of ’em.</p><p>What are you talking about?</p><p>I don’t need your credit cards. Carlos.</p><p>I don’t need your money.</p><p>But if our marriage is going to work,I need your respect.</p><p>I’m not ripping up the post-nup.</p><p>Yes, you are.</p><p>Because if you don’t,I’m gonna put on my new shoes and walk out the door.</p><p>Are you threatening me?</p><p>No, i’m just pointing something out.</p><p>I’m a pretty girl.</p><p>And pretty girls are never lonely.</p><p>Stop! I’m really ticklish!</p><p>So, uh, children’s books, right?</p><p>Don’t, don’t. That tickles!</p><p>I hope you know how lucky you are.</p><p>Not everyone gets to realize their bliss.</p><p>Yeah, it... It can be rewarding.</p><p>Why don’t you join me?</p><p>No.</p><p>I’m really ticklish!</p><p>Come on! What’s wrong?</p><p>For god’s sakes, she’s ticklish!</p><p>How many times do you have to be told?</p><p>Oh... This is so much fun. Let’s find another CD.</p><p>Mother, don’t you think it’s getting a little late?</p><p>Come on!</p><p>You haven’t even finished your schnapps.</p><p>The perfect capper to the perfect evening.</p><p>So, goodnight. It’s been lovely.</p><p>Lamont, good luck with all your inventions.</p><p>Well, it’s only 11:30.</p><p>I wanna hit the clubs!</p><p>I know a great place just off the interstate. Come on.</p><p>Warm up the old war wagon. Mom, hold it!</p><p>You are not getting into the car alone with those two.</p><p>You barely know them.</p><p>I have great instincts about people, I always have, Susie, you know that.</p><p>You’ve been married four times.</p><p>Yes, but twice to the same guy.</p><p>Mother... Susie, please, you’re embarrassing me.</p><p>I’m embarrassing you? Yes. And I’ve had it!</p><p>All night long, I’ve been trying toget you to stop being so crabby.</p><p>And you refuse to let me help.</p><p>Oh, and your idea of helping is letting Tim just grope you?</p><p>Hey, you shouldn’t talk to your mother like that,she’s a fine lady...</p><p>Tim, could you just stay out of it?</p><p>Yeah, mind your own business.</p><p>What’s your problem, pal?</p><p>Dude you were feelin’ up her mother.</p><p>It pissed me off, too. C’mon, Susie, let’s go back inside.</p><p>Let’s go back inside? Lamont, give it up.</p><p>You’re not getting any.</p><p>Why are you being this way?</p><p>I’m just trying to lighten things up.</p><p>Stop acting like tonight was about helping me.</p><p>You wanted to go out and have funAnd Lamont over there needed a date.</p><p>That’s not true. Yes, it is.</p><p>Ok, fine. It’s true.</p><p>I wanted to get out and have fun. Why shouldn’t I?</p><p>You know how depressed I’ve beenOver my break-up with Morty.</p><p>Yeah, I do.</p><p>That’s what makes me crazy, the difference between us.</p><p>You could be heartbroken and you can just... move on.</p><p>And I...</p><p>Am just broken.</p><p>I know you’re sad. No, mom, I’m not sad.</p><p>And I’m not crabby.</p><p>I’m devastated. And you keep actinglike all I need is a couple of aspirin.</p><p>Morty was just one guy in a series of guys for you.</p><p>And Mike...</p><p>He was the one.</p><p>Why don’t you get that?</p><p>Mrs. Mccluskey?</p><p>Mrs. Mccluskey, are you all right?</p><p>How did you get in here?</p><p>Uh, Mr. Mullins had a spare.</p><p>Why didn’t you open the door?</p><p>I was hoping you’d go away.</p><p>Have you been taking your medication?
