I brought you a chicken sandwich and a glass of milk.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: I am hungry. Thanks, Dad. What time is it, anyway?</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Ten o&#39;clock. What are you working on?</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: I&#39;m writing a story for the high-school paper.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Can&#39;t you finish it tomorrow?</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: No, I have to turn it in in the morning.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: What&#39;s it about?</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: I&#39;m writing an article on the feelings about graduation.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: And... how do you feel?</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Me? A little scared. And excited, too.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: I felt the same way.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: The scary part&#39;s leaving home and moving to college.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Oh, leaving home is part of growing up. Well, don&#39;t work all night.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: I don&#39;t mind. I enjoy writing.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Well, maybe you should think about becoming a writer.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Maybe I should.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: You have lots of time to decide.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: That&#39;s the worst part—making decisions.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: You&#39;ll be OK. Good night, Son.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Good night, Dad. Grandpa</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: &quot;Hail to the victors valiant, Hail to the conquering heroes, Hail, Hail to Michigan, The champions of the West!&quot;</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Ah, good morning Robbie.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Good morning, Dad.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: How&#39;s my grandson?</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Fine, Grandpa. Fine! What&#39;s all the cheering about? Did the University of Michigan win another football game?</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Better than that. Tell him Philip.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: I just spoke with Charley Rafer.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Who&#39;s Charley Rafer?</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: He&#39;s the Dean of Admission for the University of Michigan.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: And it turns out he&#39;s a classmate of Philip&#39;s.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: We were both on the tennis team.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Great!</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: It is great. He&#39;s going to be in New York tomorrow to interview applicants for admission.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: And he&#39;s agreed to fit you into his schedule.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: But I may not want to go to Michigan.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: It&#39;s one of the best schools in the country, Robbie. I studied medicine there. Your grandfather went to the Engineering School there.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: I know that, but...</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: You said you wanted to be a doctor like your father.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Not exactly.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: You couldn&#39;t pick a finer medical school than Michigan.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Yes, I know that.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Let&#39;s meet with Charley at the university club. Ten o&#39;clock tomorrow morning. It doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re going to Michigan.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: It doesn&#39;t mean you have to be a doctor. But the interview will be good experience for you.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: In that case, it&#39;s OK. Dad, growing up means making my own decisions, doesn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: You&#39;re right, Robbie. But, like your Grandpa suggested, have the interview.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: And then make your own decision.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: That sounds fine.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: I know it&#39;s sudden, Robbie, but this is an important opportunity. We&#39;ll head down there first thing tomorrow morning. OK?</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Sure, Dad.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: I want you to know something, Son. I&#39;m... very proud of you.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Thanks, Dad.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Well, I&#39;ve got an appointment at the hospital. I&#39;ll see you all at dinner time.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Bye, Dad.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Is something still wrong, Robbie?</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: I&#39;ll be OK.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Going away to college for the first time always makes one a little nervous.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: I guess so. I&#39;ll be OK. I just need time to think.</p><h2 id="act-2" tabindex="-1">Act 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#act-2" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Act 2&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Sorry, Robbie. Sorry to be late this morning, but, well, we&#39;ve still got some time for a cup of coffee. I can&#39;t wait to see my old pal Charley Rafer.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Neither can I.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: So you thought about it, huh?</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Yes, I have, Dad.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Well, I&#39;m glad. I knew you&#39;d realize that this interview could be an important experience for you.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: I came to that conclusion.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: That&#39;s very wise, Robbie. Very wise. Now let&#39;s head off for the city and the university club.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Thanks, Dad.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Thanks... for what?</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Thanks for hearing me out. And...</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: And...?</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: And thanks for being such an understanding father.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Well, thank you, Robbie. Thank you.</p><p><strong>Dean</strong>: Philip Stewart! It&#39;s great to see you!</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Charley Rafer—you look as young as ever.</p><p><strong>Dean</strong>: You must be Robbie.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Hi.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Yes, this is my youngest son Robbie. Robbie, I want you to meet one of the best tennis players on the Michigan team—Charley Rafer.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Nice to meet you, Dean Rafer.</p><p><strong>Dean</strong>: Well, are you as good a tennis player as your dad?</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: No, I&#39;m not very good at it.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Frankly, neither was I. Charley was the star of the team.</p><p><strong>Dean</strong>: Yeah. Thanks. Well, how&#39;ve you been, Philip?</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Oh, working too hard.</p><p><strong>Dean</strong>: Doesn&#39;t show. How&#39;s Ellen?</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Fine, thank you. And how&#39;s Marge?</p><p><strong>Dean</strong>: She&#39;s still giving the toughest English history exams in the school and loving every minute of it. And speaking of minutes, I have interviews until noon, so why don&#39;t we get right to work?</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Can you have lunch with us later?</p><p><strong>Dean</strong>: I&#39;d love to, Philip, but I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t. I&#39;m only here two days, and I have interviews with twenty-six applicants.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: I understand. Well, thanks. I&#39;ll wait outside. Good luck, Son.</p><p><strong>Dean</strong>: Did you bring your transcript from high school?</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Yes, sir. Right here.</p><p><strong>Dean</strong>: Thank you. Please sit down.</p><p><strong>Dean</strong>: I see under &quot;activities&quot; that you&#39;ve been writing for the school paper.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Yes, sir.</p><p><strong>Dean</strong>: What kinds of articles have you written?</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: All kinds—sports, editorials, theater reviews. You name it, I&#39;ve written it.</p><p><strong>Dean</strong>: Hmmm. Well, have you ever thought of becoming a journalist?</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: A professional writer? Not until recently.</p><p><strong>Dean</strong>: Michigan has a fine School of Journalism.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Yes, I know that.</p><p><strong>Dean</strong>: You seem to have some reservations.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: I&#39;m a little uncertain.</p><p><strong>Dean</strong>: It&#39;s been very nice talking to you.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Nice talking to you, sir.</p><p><strong>Dean</strong>: One piece of advice. The most important thing is for you to decide your own future.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Yes, sir. Good-bye, Dean Rafer.</p><p><strong>Dean</strong>: Good-bye, Robbie. Good luck.</p><h2 id="act-3" tabindex="-1">Act 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#act-3" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Act 3&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Mike</strong>: I had an interview today, too. I had a great interview with Admissions at Columbia University.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Really? What did they say? Will you get into the school?</p><p><strong>Mike</strong>: Well, they didn&#39;t say anything for sure. But I figure that with my grades and with my personality, I&#39;ll have no problem.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Columbia&#39;s a terrific school. What are you going to do?</p><p><strong>Mike</strong>: Do? I don&#39;t know. I also applied to NYU.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: You sound excited about Columbia. What&#39;s your problem, Mike?</p><p><strong>Mike</strong>: Indecision. Indecision. It&#39;s not easy, and this is an important decision we have to make. What about you? How was your interview with Michigan?</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: The interview was fine.</p><p><strong>Mike</strong>: It&#39;s a great college.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: It is. My father would like me to go there. He and my Grandpa both went there.</p><p><strong>Mike</strong>: Great medical school, too.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: I know.</p><p><strong>Mike</strong>: You can follow in your father&#39;s footsteps.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Ah! I&#39;d like to follow in my own footsteps, Mike.</p><p><strong>Mike</strong>: What do you want to study?</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: I&#39;ve been thinking. I think I want to study journalism to be a reporter—a newspaperman.</p><p><strong>Mike</strong>: You do a pretty good job on the Riverdale High School paper.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: And I&#39;ve been thinking about it a lot lately.</p><p><strong>Mike</strong>: Have you discussed it with your parents?</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: No. But I have to.</p><p><strong>Mike</strong>: OK. Let&#39;s talk.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Hi, Dad. Everything&#39;s fine. I was just waiting for you to get home so we could talk.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Anything special you want to talk about?</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: There is, Dad.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: I&#39;m listening.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Well, I know you and Mom have given up a lot to save money for my college tuition.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: We want you to go to college, Robbie.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: I know. I do.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: But?</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Well, I&#39;ve thought a lot about which college, and one of them is Columbia.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Columbia? Why Columbia?</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: First, they have an excellent School of Journalism.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: They do. And your friends are planning to go to Columbia?</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: That&#39;s only part of it. It&#39;s complicated. I&#39;ll try to explain. Mike and I had a hamburger this afternoon, and we talked.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Yes?</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Well, we talked about a lot of things. He applied to Columbia, and his interview was very successful. He thinks he&#39;ll be accepted, and he really wants to go there.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Dean Rafer called me today. He told me he was very impressed with you.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: He&#39;s a nice man. He was very kind.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: He told me you had some doubts about wanting to go to Michigan.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Yes. I do. I&#39;m just not sure about what I want to do.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: That&#39;s OK.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: You understand?</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Let me tell you something, Robbie. Something that might be surprising to you.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: What? Tell me.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Well, Grandpa wanted me to study engineering, like him. Well, I wasn&#39;t clear about my future, but I knew engineering was not for me.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: What did you tell Grandpa?</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: The truth.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Then you&#39;re not upset about my not wanting to go into medicine?</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: I&#39;m not upset at all. I&#39;m just happy that we&#39;re able to talk about it.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: I am too, Dad.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: I suppose you want to apply to Columbia.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Yes, but I also wanted to apply to several other colleges.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: I thought you wanted to go to Columbia.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Well, I might want to go to Columbia. But I might not. I just want to be able to make my own decision.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: You&#39;re a real Stewart!</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: And if I think about it long enough, you never know...</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Never know what?</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: If I make my own decision, I might choose Michigan.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Robbie, you&#39;re something! You know, when I was your age, I said exactly the same thing to Grandpa.</p>',171),r=[i];function a(p,g,h,l,b,u){return n(),t("div",null,r)}const y=o(s,[["render",a]]);export{m as __pageData,y as default};
