I think I&#39;ve got them all, but I&#39;m not sure.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: I think you have got it, Richard. Lincoln Center, home of the Metropolitan Opera, the New York City Ballet, the New York Philharmonic.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Shubert Alley, center of the theater on Broadway.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: And Carnegie Hall. And the others. I do have it all.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: You have been working on this for some time, Richard. I&#39;m glad you feel you&#39;ve finally put it all together. What now?</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Now for the hard part.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Oh, you think you&#39;re going to have a hard time getting the album published?</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Well, it won&#39;t be easy.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: So, what do you think you&#39;re going to do?</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Does the name Harvey Carlson ring a bell?</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Oh, yes! Harvey Carlson! I remember.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: He said I should call him. He&#39;s the publisher of the Carlson Publishing Company. He said they need a new book of photographs, and he really liked my concept.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: So, why don&#39;t you call him in the morning?</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Do you think I have enough to show him?</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: I&#39;ve been through every section with you, Richard. It&#39;s quite complete. And now that you&#39;re satisfied with the performing arts section, I think you should show it to Mr. Carlson.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: You&#39;re right. My Family Album, U.S.A. feels right. I&#39;ll call in the morning and set up an appointment to see him.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: He&#39;s going to love your work. Come on. Let&#39;s get some sleep.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Is it too early to call Mr. Carlson?</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Seven after nine? No. I&#39;m sure he&#39;s in his office.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: His number is five, five, five, seven, five, three, two. Five, five, five, seven, five, three, two. Hello. Mr. Carlson, please.</p><p><strong>Receptionist</strong>: Mr. Carlson is busy at the moment. May I help you?</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: I&#39;d like to make an appointment with him.</p><p><strong>Receptionist</strong>: And your name is...?</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: My name is Richard Stewart. He told me to call him about my project, Family Album, U.S.A.</p><p><strong>Receptionist</strong>: Mr. Stewart, I just spoke to Mr. Carlson. He would like to see you. But the only time he&#39;s available this week is tomorrow morning at ten o&#39;clock.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Thanks. Thanks a lot. Good-bye. Well, it&#39;s done. Tomorrow morning at a publisher&#39;s office.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Oh, it&#39;s so exciting, isn&#39;t it, Richard?</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Well, finally a publisher will see my work.</p><h2 id="act-2" tabindex="-1">Act 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#act-2" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Act 2&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Receptionist</strong>: Good morning.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Good morning. My name is Richard Stewart. I&#39;m here to see Mr. Carlson.</p><p><strong>Receptionist</strong>: Please sit down, Mr. Stewart. Mr. Carlson will be with you shortly.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Thank you.</p><p><strong>Receptionist</strong>: Excuse me, Mr. Carlson, but Richard Stewart is here for his ten o&#39;clock appointment with you. OK. Thank you. Like I said, he&#39;ll be with you shortly.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Thank you.</p><p><strong>Receptionist</strong>: Yes, Mr. Carlson. Yes, sir. He&#39;s ready for you, Mr. Stewart.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Thank you. In there?</p><p><strong>Receptionist</strong>: Yes. In there. Good luck.</p><p><strong>Carlson</strong>: Come in, come in. This is a crazy morning. Hello, Richard.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Hello, Mr. Carlson.</p><p><strong>Carlson</strong>: Sit down, sit down.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Thank you for seeing me on such short notice.</p><p><strong>Carlson</strong>: I hope you&#39;ve brought your pictures along. I see that you have. Let&#39;s get right to it. We need a new coffee-table book, and a book of photos about the United States still feels right. OK, let&#39;s take a look. Good. Very good. Family Album, U.S.A. It&#39;s an excellent title. If you had to describe the book in one sentence, how would you do it?</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Well, I&#39;d describe it as a book which is a ... a portrait of the United States—the places, the people—mostly the people. The things they do, the ways they live, the places they visit, and the landmarks. A photographic journey.</p><p><strong>Carlson</strong>: These are wonderful—these photos in your performing arts section. Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: I&#39;m glad you like them.</p><p><strong>Carlson</strong>: I do, but...</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: But?</p><p><strong>Carlson</strong>: There&#39;s something missing. You&#39;ve got a good eye, Richard. You&#39;re a terrific photographer. But before I can publish your work, I need to meet with my marketing department, and you&#39;ve got to do one more thing.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: What&#39;s that, Mr. Carlson?</p><p><strong>Carlson</strong>: In the section on culture, you&#39;ve included performing arts centers, but you&#39;ve left out street performance. The mimes. The musicians. The dancers—in the parks and on the streets. Richard, if you go out and photograph street performances in the city, you&#39;ll have it.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: That is a great idea. The performing arts centers and the street performances. I&#39;ll do it.</p><p><strong>Carlson</strong>: If you do it, I&#39;ll publish your work.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Are you serious?</p><p><strong>Carlson</strong>: I&#39;ve never been more serious. When do you think you can return with street performances?</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: A couple of weeks.</p><p><strong>Carlson</strong>: If they&#39;re as good as the rest of these pictures, it&#39;s a deal.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: You won&#39;t be disappointed, Mr. Carlson. Thanks.</p><p><strong>Carlson</strong>: Good-bye, Richard, and good luck. See you in two weeks.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Good-bye, Mr. Carlson. Thanks. So if you like the street-performance photos, you&#39;ll really publish Family Album, U.S.A.?</p><p><strong>Carlson</strong>: When I say something, I mean it. Go to work. Goodbye.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Good-bye.</p><h2 id="act-3" tabindex="-1">Act 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#act-3" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Act 3&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Two weeks. I said I could do it in two weeks, and I did it.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: The pictures you&#39;ve taken are fabulous, Richard. Mr. Carlson will love them.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Monday morning. I&#39;m going to show him the photos on Monday morning. I can&#39;t wait!</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: I&#39;m very proud of you. You really did a beautiful job. I know he will love the new photographs for your book.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Yeah. I really did do a good job, didn&#39;t I? Hey, you know? There&#39;s still some film left on this roll, and there&#39;s one person I haven&#39;t photographed in a long time.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Who?</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: You.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Richard! I haven&#39;t brushed my hair.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: You look great!</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: It&#39;s not fair, Richard. I&#39;m not even ready.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Oh, that&#39;s wonderful! That&#39;s wonderful!</p><p><strong>Carlson</strong>: Wonderful!</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Thanks.</p><p><strong>Carlson</strong>: Fabulous!</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Thanks!</p><p><strong>Carlson</strong>: Terrific!</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Thanks.</p><p><strong>Carlson</strong>: They get better and better.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Thanks a lot.</p><p><strong>Carlson</strong>: This is sensational!</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Yeah.

They represent your best work.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Really?</p><p><strong>Carlson</strong>: Absolutely.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Well... what do you think? Do I have my book?</p><p><strong>Carlson</strong>: You do. You do. There&#39;s a book here, I&#39;ll have a contract and an advance payment waiting for you first thing in the morning.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Thank you.</p><p><strong>Carlson</strong>: And while you&#39;re here I would like to introduce you to your editor. And I want you to meet the people in the art department. I&#39;ll set up an appointment with the marketing people.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: When do you think we&#39;ll be through?</p><p><strong>Carlson</strong>: In about half an hour. Why?</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: I can&#39;t wait to tell Marilyn!</p>',101),a=[s];function i(h,p,l,g,d,c){return r(),t("div",null,a)}const m=o(n,[["render",i]]);export{y as __pageData,m as default};
