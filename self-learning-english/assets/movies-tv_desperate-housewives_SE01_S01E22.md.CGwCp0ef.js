Peterson called me into his office.</p><p>...went from bad... He’s holding the promotion for Duggan.</p><p>...to worse. I’m pregnant and it might be yours.</p><p>Edie Brit’s favorite moment of every daywas her arrival at the construction site of her new home,because she knew what was about to happen.</p><p>Her sudden appearancewas always sure to generate a few appreciative glances,a few lascivious looks,and some downright ogling.</p><p>Sadly for Edie, the one man she wanted most to notice her...</p><p>...paid her no attention at all.</p><p>Yes, Edie needed attention to feel good about herself.</p><p>And she was determined to get it.</p><p>Miss Britt, you look extra beautiful today.</p><p>Cyrus, you’re so sweet.</p><p>So anyhow, I was wondering if maybe...</p><p>I could uh... take you out to dinner some time.</p><p>Oh, honey, you are so far out of your leaguethat you are playing a completely different sport.</p><p>Hey, Edie. What’s up?</p><p>Nice ensemble. You busy? No, not really.</p><p>Good. I bought fresh donuts for my construction workersand as you can see, I bought a few too many.</p><p>So I thought you and I could...</p><p>Susan. Hey there, Edie.</p><p>What... what are you... Mike and I got back together.</p><p>Super. I knew you’d be happy for us.</p><p>So what’s going on? Edie was about to...</p><p>Free donuts. Want them or not?</p><p>How sweet. Thanks.</p><p>Why don’t you go put these on a plate?</p><p>And save me one with sprinkles.</p><p>I cannot believe you are still coming onto him.</p><p>You said you were finished. You thought he was a murderer.</p><p>And that was your cue to come and flirt?</p><p>You wasted your time and your donuts.</p><p>Not if you choke on them.</p><p>Thanks, Edie. The donuts look great. Pleasure.</p><p>See you.</p><p>I’m gonna run homeand get some milk to go with those donuts.</p><p>Hey. It’s a shame you’ve got to keep running back and forth.</p><p>I can’t have donuts and juice, it’s unnatural.</p><p>No, I mean, we should move in together.</p><p>Come on. What do you say? Oh! um... I say um... Ooh!</p><p>Hold that thought. Edie! Edie! Stop!</p><p>Hang on. What now?</p><p>I was just rude back there, gloating and everything.</p><p>I apologize.</p><p>Thank you, Susan. That’s very big of you.</p><p>And on a completely unrelated topic,Mike and I are moving in together. Seeya!</p><p>Yes, Edie Britt needed the attention of mento feel good about herself.</p><p>Hey, Cyrus. You have lunch plans?</p><p>No.</p><p>And even she was amazed at how farshe was willing to go to get it.</p><p>Ellsberg Hotel, half an hour.</p><p>Welcome to the majors.</p><p>Mr. and Mrs. Edwin Mullinswere finally leaving Wisteria Lane.</p><p>In the past year, their street had played host to arson,violence, blackmail, and murder.</p><p>Fearing they too would be infected by this moral decay,the Mullins felt it was time to say goodbye.</p><p>Strangely enough, none of their neighborsseemed to notice they were moving out.</p><p>Hey. I thought you might be thirsty.</p><p>No, I’m good.</p><p>So how’s your roommate doing?</p><p>He’s hanging in there.</p><p>Yeah. Well, I had to tell him some newsthat was a little bit upsetting for him.</p><p>No kidding. Excuse me?</p><p>John’s not good enough to raise a child?</p><p>That kid could be his. It’s a complicated situation.</p><p>Seems pretty simple to me.</p><p>You’re an unfeeling bitch.</p><p>Why did you hit the lawn boy?</p><p>If you saw what he did to our begonias,you’d slap him too.</p><p>I can’t tell from this.</p><p>What are you doing here? What’s this?</p><p>You told me Duggan’s coming back to work.</p><p>I thought I’d do something special for him.</p><p>This has nothing to dowith you checking up on me and Annabel?</p><p>What?</p><p>Yesterday you brought pictures of the kids.</p><p>The day before that you brought me soup.</p><p>Lynette, honey, it’s got to stop.</p><p>Tom.</p><p>I don’t care about you working with Annabel.</p><p>I told you that. This is for Duggan. He had a heart attack.</p><p>I don’t care about Annabel. Hey, Lynette.</p><p>Ah. Speak of the devil.</p><p>And I mean that.</p><p>Well, you’re becoming a regular fixture around here, aren’t you?</p><p>Oh, yeah. I wanted to do something nice for Duggan.</p><p>I suppose filling his bloodstreamwith butter fat might be considered nice.</p><p>Actually, it’s fruit juice sweetened. Can I cut you...</p><p>a piece?</p><p>Everyone, I need to see you right now.</p><p>Ok, listen up. I just spoke with Tim Duggan’s wife.</p><p>It looks like he’s not going to be returning to work after all.</p><p>He had a relapse last night,which puts us in a very tight spot.</p><p>but we’re gonna work together as a teamand do what we need to do.</p><p>Jerry, take the Hollister account,Suzanne, Paradise Springs,And, Annabel, take the lead on the Traveler’s hotel chain.</p><p>You leave for Hawaii in three days.</p><p>I can’t do travelers by myself.</p><p>Not if they’re moving into print.</p><p>Well, choose someone to take with you.</p><p>Oh. Ok. Um...</p><p>I choose... Tom.</p><p>Let’s see.</p><p>I’ve beaten you at bridge and mahjong and hearts.</p><p>This is your last chance to redeem yourself.</p><p>Stop it. You’re gonna make me laugh.</p><p>Ok. Ok, I’ll be good.</p><p>Miss it, miss it, miss it. Bree.</p><p>Come on. I’m allowed to psych you out.</p><p>Ok. Time’s up. Take your best shot.</p><p>I’m not ready yet.</p><p>Hurry up. There are people waiting. One more minute.</p><p>Come on, take your... Don’t do that!</p><p>George...</p><p>Do you have an erection?</p><p>I’m sorry.</p><p>What on earth? You were blowing on my ear.</p><p>I was teasing you. Exactly.</p><p>You have got to get rid of it. There are children present.</p><p>How? I don’t know!</p><p>Think of something unpleasant. Like what?</p><p>Like famine or disease or hoboes.</p><p>Whatever. Just hurry.</p><p>You can’t be mad about it.</p><p>It’s not something men can control.</p><p>I kept this friendship goingbecause I thought Rex’s dislike of you was paranoid.</p><p>But you had feelings for me all along.</p><p>God, this is just such a betrayal.</p><p>Come on, Bree.</p><p>The only thing I’m guilty of is loving you in silence.</p><p>Well, you shouldn’t be doing that.</p><p>In case you’ve forgotten, I’m married.</p><p>To a selfish 2-faced liarwho betrayed you with a hooker.</p><p>I told you that in confidence.</p><p>How dare you throw it back in my face?</p><p>So you’re ending our friendship, after everything I’ve done for you?</p><p>What is that supposed to mean?</p><p>Nothing. It didn’t mean anything.</p><p>George. I do love you. As a friend.</p><p>I wish you could love me the same way back,but since you can’t...</p><p>Goodbye.</p><p>Later that day,Edie Britt witnessed something disturbing.</p><p>Something she was determined to put a stop to.</p><p>Is Susan coming? She said she might be late.</p><p>They’ve started moving Mike’s things to her house.</p><p>Already? Wow. Good for her.</p><p>Yeah. It’s nice to see Susan so happy again.</p><p>Yeah, I’m happy for Susan.</p><p>But don’t you think she and Mike are moving a little fast?</p><p>I mean, two days ago she thought he was a murdererand now she’s moving in with him?</p><p>But she found out it was in self-defense.</p><p>I think they’ve cleared everything up. Good point.</p><p>Mike’s a decent guy. Yeah, that’s true.</p><p>Of course, there was the gunshot wound...</p><p>That’s right. Did he ever explain that?</p><p>No. And I know guns,and that wound was not self-inflicted.</p><p>And then what about Mrs. Huber’s bloodstained jewelry?</p><p>Yeah. That didn’t walk into Mike’s garage by itself.</p><p>Maybe this is a mistake.</p><p>You know, if there’s one thing I’ve learned,men can’t be trusted.</p><p>Hold it. Are you saying that we should put a stop to this?</p><p>I guess it wouldn’t hurt to sit her down and share our concerns.</p><p>Yeah, we could do that. Yeah.</p><p>Edie, do you want to be a part of it?</p><p>Normally I prefer not to get involved.</p><p>But...</p><p>If there’s any way that I could help Susan...</p><p>We need to talk. Ok.</p><p>When I was packing up your stuff in your bedroomI found a box of bullets.</p><p>Look, I feel really bad about Deidreand I know you must want to find out who killed herbut if we are going to move in together,we can’t have this stuff hanging over us.</p><p>You’ve got to get rid of it. All of it.</p><p>The file, the map, the gun. Especially the gun.</p><p>Leave this to the police. They’re the professionals.</p><p>What can I say? Um...</p><p>It seems like a reasonable request.</p><p>Oh. Really? Well, that was easy.</p><p>Maybe after lunch we could talk about your leather beanbag chair.</p><p>”I realize now that I’ve treated you badly.””I’m the one who needs to get help, not you.””So I have to go away.””In the meantime, Mrs. Tillman will look out for you.”I don’t consider it a burden. You know you’re welcome here.</p><p>”I’ve left you some things.””I hope you can take comfort in them.””I got you a new mitt.””Work on your curve ball while I’m gone.””I love you. Dad.”I don’t understand. Why wouldn’t he come see me?</p><p>Why just run away?</p><p>Your father’s been very troubled.</p><p>Dear, I’m sure he did what he felt was best for you.</p><p>And he wants me to take comfort in this junk?</p><p>I hate baseball. You’d think he’d know that.</p><p>Zach...</p><p>Susan’s coming. Ok.</p><p>Ok, guys. Interventions are never pretty.</p><p>So stay strong ’cause she’s probably gonna cry.</p><p>Bonjour. Mwah, mwah.</p><p>Oh, hi. I didn’t know that the cooking lessonwas gonna be a group activity.</p><p>Well, the more the merrier, right?</p><p>As long as no one makes fun of my crepes.</p><p>How come I’m the only one wearing an apron?</p><p>It seems like we’re ganging up on youbut you were moving so fastwe thought a sort of intervention was necessary.</p><p>I know it’s tough to hear. None of us wanted to do this.</p><p>I appreciate what you guys are trying to do. I really do. Um...</p><p>I’m not gonna change my mind.</p><p>In my life, I’ve been hurt a lot.</p><p>Karl and uh...</p><p>Well, it’s just taught me to be cynicaland expect the absolute worst from people.</p><p>I don’t want to live like that any more,and when Mike asked me to move in with him,I was just happy, you know, just ridiculously happy.</p><p>I mean, I still am. And I want to go with that feeling.</p><p>I love him and... I love him.</p><p>So I’m gonna expect the best from Mikeand I know that he is gonna deliver that in return.</p><p>Ok? Honey.</p><p>This is the worst intervention I have ever been to.</p><p>This is fun. It’s forever since we had lunch.</p><p>Well, as happy as I am to see you,I actually have an agenda.</p><p>I ran into someone last week who said you guys are looking to hire.</p><p>Is that true? Yeah.</p><p>Are you thinking of coming back? Because say the word...</p><p>No, not me. I was actually thinking more about Tom.</p><p>Oh. Tom.</p><p>Yeah, he’s been thinking about making a move for a while.</p><p>He feels like he’s done everything he can where he is now.</p><p>Well, Tom’s certainly solid.</p><p>He’s more than solid. Tom’s ideas are spectacular.</p><p>He’s passionate about his work.</p><p>His visual instincts are off the chart.</p><p>Is he as good as you?</p><p>He’s apples, I’m oranges.</p><p>We excel in different areas.</p><p>Trust me, you should give Tom a look.</p><p>I don’t need apples.</p><p>I need someone like you.</p><p>Cutthroat. Ruthless.</p><p>Oh. Geez, Nat. You make me sound like some kind of shark.</p><p>Oh. Ok.</p><p>You know, actually...</p><p>If that’s the kind of exec you’re looking for...</p><p>You got a shark for me?</p><p>Yes. A very pretty shark.</p><p>So here’s what I’m thinking.</p><p>I’m gonna see if Dr. Morrison at the Lipstone cliniccan come in and consult.</p><p>You want to bring someone else in?</p><p>Your body isn’t responding to the medication the way it should.</p><p>The tests we’ve run have all come back negative so I...</p><p>I just want to be on the safe side.</p><p>Will you excuse me? I need to take this.</p><p>I don’t know why,but I have this overwhelming feelingthat you’re gonna be just fine. I really do.</p><p>Lee Craig has the biggest ego of any doctor I know.</p><p>If he wants to consult with someone,that means he’s stumped.</p><p>Which means I’m screwed. Don’t say that.</p><p>Damn it, Bree, do you understand what’s going on here?</p><p>I could die.</p><p>So could I. What?</p><p>I could walk across the street tomorrow and be hit by a car.</p><p>What in god’s name is your point?</p><p>All I’m saying is that we’re both gonna die eventually.</p><p>In the time that we have left,whether it’s two days or two decades,I think we should be nice to each other.</p><p>You’re right.</p><p>Um... Miss Tillman.</p><p>Paul Young’s been missing for a last couple of days.</p><p>Have you seen him?</p><p>Why ask me?</p><p>I saw him leave a box on your doorstep.</p><p>And I’ve seen Zach over here.</p><p>If I did know where Mr. Young was, why would I tell you?</p><p>Look, the police think I killed your sisterand I’m sure you do too.</p><p>But I swear I had nothing to do with it.</p><p>And you think Paul Young did.</p><p>Well... No, that’s not what I was saying.</p><p>You gotta admit, it’s a neat theory.</p><p>Care for a snack?</p><p>So it’s not such a stretch.</p><p>I wonder if Paul avenged his wife’s deathby killing Martha for blackmailing them.</p><p>But perhaps I’m alone in that.</p><p>You’re not. Aren’t you sweet? Tea?</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>Does this say anything about why she was blackmailing the Youngs?</p><p>Not specifically.</p><p>But I got the definite impression that it involved a murder,and now here you are saying your friend was murdered.</p><p>Any reason you haven’t shown these to the police?</p><p>Are you in favor of the death penalty?</p><p>Um... Yeah.</p><p>So am I. We had it in utah.</p><p>Not in this state, though.</p><p>A shame, don’t you agree?</p><p>Yeah, I do.</p><p>I like you so much, Mr. Delfino.</p><p>Do you know where Paul Young is?</p><p>I’m afraid not.</p><p>But I know where he’ll be on Thursday night.</p><p>That afternoon, while retrieving her mail,Gabrielle was surprised to finally learnthe truth behind her pregnancy.</p><p>Very surprised.</p><p>Babe, you want to go online and check out strollers?</p><p>What’s going on?</p><p>I just want to say goodbye, because I’m leaving you.</p><p>What?</p><p>See, our health insurance sent us a letter,because someone ordered a year’s worth of my birth control pills.</p><p>Apparently our policy doesn’t cover drugs bought by that kilo.</p><p>I told you it was mama.</p><p>The prescription was dated. CarlosAnd Juanita was in a coma when this claim was filed.</p><p>You did this. Not your mother.</p><p>At least be man enough to own up to it. She would have been.</p><p>Stop!</p><p>Pregnant, caveman. Remember?</p><p>Where are you going? Away.</p><p>I’m going to jail. I’ll be gone tomorrow.</p><p>I know. That’s why I only packed one bag.</p><p>What about the baby, Gabrielle? Huh?</p><p>What about my baby?</p><p>Oh, your baby? Fine. Our baby.</p><p>We’re a family now. This baby needs its mother and its father.</p><p>Oh, Carlos. Who ever said you were the father?</p><p>Hey. What the hell are you doing?</p><p>Damn felon!</p><p>All units, code D 16-30.</p><p>Suspect is in violation of house arrest.</p><p>Heading west on Park boulevard.</p><p>This is unit 14. We’re on our way.</p><p>Looks like the FEDs have a runner. Let’s go.</p><p>Is John here?</p><p>If I say no will you slap me again?</p><p>He’s working. Why?</p><p>I just left my husband.</p><p>Hang on.</p><p>Think just because you mow my lawn, you can bang my wife?</p><p>Hey. What’s going on?</p><p>Tom, I have had the craziest day.</p><p>This morning the guys from Mitchell and Kernscall me and offer me a job.</p><p>Are you gonna take it? I told Peterson about it.</p><p>He just upped their offer. He just made me vice president!</p><p>Of what? Tom! The firm!</p><p>He gave me Duggan’s old job! Isn’t that wild?!</p><p>I gotta go tell Scotty. I’ll see you later.</p><p>Tom, I was just coming to find you.</p><p>What the hell, Dan? I mean, what the hell?</p><p>You promoted Annabel over me?</p><p>She got another job offer. I couldn’t afford to lose her. Not now.</p><p>Well, guess what. You lose me. ’cause I quit.</p><p>Tom, don’t overreact. No.</p><p>The first time you passed me byI took it like a good soldier.</p><p>But since Duggan had a heart attack,I have already been doing the job.</p><p>I have been doing it and then you just hand it to Annabel?</p><p>Ok. You made your point.</p><p>You know, You make crappy decisions on a daily baises,Dan, I gotta tell you.</p><p>But this one, this is the stupidest.</p><p>Hey, watch yourself.</p><p>You have been running this company into the ground since you got here.</p><p>Well, I see I’m getting out easy.</p><p>All right. ScavoYou want to know why I gave that promotion to Annabel?</p><p>Why she got the nod instead of you?</p><p>It was Lynette.</p><p>What? She went to my wife and begged herto get me to kill your promotion.</p><p>She said that if you start traveling more,it’s gonna hurt your family.</p><p>She did that?</p><p>Now I feel like a chump for trying to help you guys out.</p><p>I guess it was another one of my crappy decisions.</p><p>Have your desk cleaned out by tonight.</p><p>You gonna tell us what you got against this kid?</p><p>It’s between him and me. And my wife.</p><p>Is that what this is about? You doing his wife?</p><p>No. I’m gay.</p><p>You’re gay? What?</p><p>I’m gay.</p><p>This is not happening again.</p><p>What do you mean, again?</p><p>I want a lawyer.</p><p>All baggers to the front.</p><p>Got a cleanup on aisle four. Cleanup on aisle four.</p><p>George.</p><p>Hi. What are you doing here?</p><p>I’m shopping. Obviously.</p><p>Why are you shopping here?</p><p>You live on the other side of town.</p><p>My friend had an operation. I’m buying her some things.</p><p>Oh. That’s very nice of you.</p><p>Wait. Bree. I have to tell you something.</p><p>Well?</p><p>You need to tell Rex to be more discreetwhen it comes to discussing your love life.</p><p>I’m sorry? I don’t want to say anything more.</p><p>You just really need to tell him that.</p><p>Wait a minute. What in the world are you talking about?</p><p>I was at the hospital visiting my friend who had had this operation.</p><p>I overheard two doctorstalking about Rex’s fondness for s&amp; m.</p><p>You heard that?</p><p>Apparently he told them he has a box of toysand he gets you to do very inappropriate things.</p><p>I see.</p><p>This is clearly none of my businessand I would have never brought this upBut to hear those two men laughing about you...</p><p>I just thought you should know.</p><p>Thank you for telling mebut I think I gotta go.</p><p>Hey, got some more boxes.</p><p>That’s your answer to everything these days.</p><p>What do you want to do for dinner?</p><p>Oh, I can’t. I just got an emergency phone call.</p><p>Busted water main. Ok.</p><p>I’ll keep it warm for you.</p><p>I’m afraid I’m gonna be too late for dinner.</p><p>I wasn’t talking about dinner.</p><p>Need some help? Uh... No.</p><p>No, I got it. Um...</p><p>I got it.</p><p>So if you have a plumbing emergency,shouldn’t you get going?</p><p>Oh, I’m just part of the relief crew.</p><p>Oh. Well, I’ll just get back to work.</p><p>Mom, stalking? Are we really doing this?</p><p>You just made a huge deal about how much you trust him.</p><p>That was before I found Mrs. Huber’s journal in his truck.</p><p>So what’s in it?</p><p>It’s not about what’s in it,it’s about the fact that he had it at all.</p><p>I’d bet you anything he’s not going on a plumbing joband we’re gonna find out.</p><p>Mom... If you don’t trust him,why are you moving in with him?</p><p>I don’t have time to explain adult relationships to you.</p><p>Oh, duck down.</p><p>I think you lost him. He’s six cars up.</p><p>We have to stay back or he’ll see us.</p><p>Ok, great, but we can’t see him either.</p><p>Mom, you’re not great at this.</p><p>Yeah? When your father was cheating on meI used to follow him all the time.</p><p>I know my stuff.</p><p>There he is.</p><p>What’s Mike doing? Who’s he pulling up to?</p><p>I don’t know but I’m gonna find out.</p><p>Wait here.</p><p>And lock the doors.</p><p>What the hell are you up to? Oh, my god.</p><p>Uh... Bye.</p><p>Was that your wife?</p><p>If it was, would I be here with you?</p><p>It wasn’t Mike, was it? No.</p><p>No, it wasn’t.</p><p>They’re charging you with a hate crime?</p><p>Do you remember when our cable guy was beaten up?</p><p>That was me.</p><p>I thought you were cheating with him.</p><p>With our gay cable guy?</p><p>I didn’t know he was gay.</p><p>I didn’t know Justin was either.</p><p>Now the cops think I’m some kind of serial gay basher.</p><p>Well, you sort of are. Pou provoked me!</p><p>You were pretending to have an affair just to punish me.</p><p>Well, obviously.</p><p>So now I need you to lie again.</p><p>I need you to tell the cops you were having an affairand that I just beat up the wrong guy.</p><p>Guys.</p><p>I am not lying for you, Carlos.</p><p>Gabby, if this charge sticks,I get sent away for eight years.</p><p>Am I supposed to be impressed?</p><p>Because of your stunt with my birth control pills,I’ve lost my freedom for the next 18 years.</p><p>Gabby, please don’t do this.</p><p>Gabby, don’t walk away!</p><p>Gabby!</p><p>Ok, next time I won’t bring my daughterto stalk my boyfriend.</p><p>It was a slight error in judgment.</p><p>Honey, please don’t give me the silent treatment.</p><p>I’m not.</p><p>Did you say you read this?</p><p>Part of it. Why?</p><p>Mrs. Huber was blackmailing Zach’s mom.</p><p>Zach?</p><p>What are you doing up?</p><p>I couldn’t sleep so I was just... sitting here.</p><p>Thinking.</p><p>About what?</p><p>Do you really want to know?</p><p>Bree, I’m not feeling too hot right now so just tell me.</p><p>What’s up?</p><p>I was thinking that the biggest mistake of my entire lifewas agreeing to marry you.</p><p>Let me guess. I’ve done something wrong.</p><p>Forcing me to share in your depraved pastime wasn’t enough,you had to share my humiliation with your co-workers?</p><p>What? Rex.</p><p>Everybody is talking about our sex life.</p><p>Every sordid little detail,right down to that box of perversions in the closet.</p><p>I never said anything to anyone.</p><p>I swear to god.</p><p>You’re a liar. Who told you this?</p><p>Doesn’t matter.</p><p>It does. I never said anything.</p><p>How do people know? I wouldn’t say anything.</p><p>Why would I talk about what we do in bed?</p><p>I don’t know, Rex.</p><p>Maybe you were bragging.</p><p>Or maybe you just subconsciously wanted to hurt me.</p><p>Well, congratulations. You did it.</p><p>I am officially destroyed.</p><p>I didn’t say anything. I don’t believe you.</p><p>Rex? What? What is it?</p><p>I think I’m having a heart attack.</p><p>No, you’re not.</p><p>Bree, you’re gonna have to take me to the hospital.</p><p>Um... All right. You go downstairsand um... I will be...

Where is she?</p><p>That’s a good question.</p><p>Daddy’s having a heart attack.</p><p>I know. I’m taking him to hospital.</p><p>Well, when?</p><p>When I finish making the bed.</p><p>What?</p><p>I never leave the house with an unmade bed.
