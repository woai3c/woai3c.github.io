You know, like when you create pages through drag-and-drop - that&#39;s low-code because you&#39;re just configuring parameters to generate usable pages. It&#39;s similar to coding but requires less programming knowledge.</p><p>Low-code can definitely boost efficiency, especially in simple business scenarios where you have lots of templates available. But if you&#39;re building a page from scratch or dealing with complex logic, it might actually be slower than traditional coding. That&#39;s why a good low-code platform needs to provide plenty of reusable page and app templates for quick generation.</p><p>Also, combining low-code with large language models can really speed things up. Like, a fine-tuned model can generate usable pages directly from user prompts. Though I should mention that the training process can be pretty time-consuming and expensive.</p><details><summary>查看中文</summary> 你觉得什么是低代码，低代码能提升开发效率吗？ <p>我觉得在实现同样功能的情况下，让开发者比原来少写了一些代码，这样就算是低代码。例如通过拖拉拽来生成页面，这也算是低代码，因为它需要配置一些参数才能生成可用的页面，这个行为相当于在写代码了，只不过不需要太多的编程知识。</p><p>低代码在简单的业务场景，并且提供了大量模板的情况下，是可以提升开发效率的。但是如果从零开始开发一个页面或者说页面逻辑非常复杂，效率就会比较低，比不上直接写代码效率高。所以一个好用的低代码平台必定提供了大量可复用的页面模板、应用模板，让用户能快速生成页面。</p><p>另外，如果低代码和大语言模型结合，也能快速提升开发效率。在经过微调后的大语言模型可以直接根据用户的提示直接生成一个可用的页面。但是这个训练过程可能会非常漫长，并且费用成本很高。</p></details><h2 id="you-mentioned-that-non-technical-users-can-quickly-build-applications-on-the-low-code-platform-what-user-experience-design-principles-did-the-platform-use-to-reduce-the-learning-curve-while-providing-powerful-functionalities" tabindex="-1">You mentioned that non-technical users can quickly build applications on the low-code platform.

Can you talk about one or two of your main contributions to projects, including the inspiration, technical challenges, and solutions?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Yeah, let me tell you about an open-source low-code project I worked on. At the time, low-code was really trending, and I kept seeing articles about it, but I didn&#39;t have any hands-on experience. So I decided to build a low-code project from scratch. I also wanted to make it educational with clear documentation to help front-end developers who were new to low-code get started quickly.</p><p>There were quite a few technical challenges. For example, with component rotation, you can&#39;t just calculate the rotation angle based on drag movement - it needs some complex math. Another tricky part was handling SVG components. We needed to maintain their aspect ratio during dragging, which was technically challenging. My solution was to calculate the xy coordinates of each point on the SVG component to determine their proportional values. Then during dragging, I&#39;d use these proportions to calculate new xy coordinates, keeping the SVG&#39;s aspect ratio intact.</p><details><summary>查看中文</summary> 您在 GitHub 上获得了 15,000+ stars，请谈谈您主要贡献的一个或两个项目，包括项目的灵感来源、技术难点和如何解决的？ <p>我谈一下开源的低代码项目，当时低代码比较火，经常能看到相关的文章，而我没有相关经验。所以我想着自己从零开始做一个低代码项目，顺便做成教学项目，把文档写清楚，来帮助那些不懂低代码的前端，让他们能快速入门。</p><p>技术难点有很多，例如旋转组件，不能简单的通过用户拖拽移动的位移 xy 来算出旋转的角度，还要经过一些数学计算，才能算出来。还有就是支持 SVG 组件，SVG 在拖拽时不能改变 SVG 组件的比例，这个也是一个技术难点。我是通过计算 SVG 组件每个点的 xy 坐标，算出它们的在组件上的比例值，然后拖拽时通过比例值来计算新的 xy 坐标，这样就能保证 SVG 组件的比例不变。</p></details><h2 id="please-share-an-experience-where-you-faced-a-particularly-challenging-technical-refactoring-including-the-decision-making-execution-process-and-final-outcome" tabindex="-1">Please share an experience where you faced a particularly challenging technical refactoring, including the decision-making, execution process, and final outcome. <a class="header-anchor" href="#please-share-an-experience-where-you-faced-a-particularly-challenging-technical-refactoring-including-the-decision-making-execution-process-and-final-outcome" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Please share an experience where you faced a particularly challenging technical refactoring, including the decision-making, execution process, and final outcome.&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Sure, I can share my experience of upgrading our low-code platform&#39;s application deployment to containerization. Originally, the feature could package and deploy low-code apps to a server, but it only supported one server and couldn&#39;t scale. When users started building more applications, we hit performance bottlenecks that affected server operations.</p><p>So I decided to upgrade it to containerized deployment. This meant deploying user applications on K8S, which made things like scaling, canary releases, and application rollbacks much easier. It really improved our system&#39;s stability and performance.</p><details><summary>查看中文</summary> 请分享一次特别有挑战的技术重构经验，涉及的决策、执行过程和最终的结果。 <p>我分享一下之前将低代码平台的应用部署功能改造为容器化部署的经历。原来的应用部署功能能够把低代码应用打包部署到服务器上，但是只支持一台服务器，不能扩容。当用户搭建的应用多了之后，就会有性能瓶颈，影响服务器正常运转。</p><p>所以我决定对这个功能进行升级，将它改造为容器化部署。这样用户的应用就都部署在 K8S 上了，这样就可以很方便的进行扩容、灰度更新和应用回滚等操作，大大的提升了系统的稳定性和性能。</p></details><h2 id="in-your-resume-you-mentioned-having-knowledge-of-docker-k8s-could-you-please-share-which-projects-involved-containerization" tabindex="-1">In your resume, you mentioned having knowledge of Docker/K8S.
