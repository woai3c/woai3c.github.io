Just imagine-Marilyn and Richard must be thrilled! Oh, a new baby!</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Max...Max...Max. Oh, it&#39;s a sweet-sounding name for a sweet little boy. My first grandchild.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: And my first nephew. Isn&#39;t he just adorable? He looks a lot like you, Mom. He does.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Do you think so? Well, I guess. He does look a lot like Richard, and I guess he looks a lot like me. Oh, he&#39;s got Richard&#39;s eyes, though.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: I really want Harry and Michelle to see Max.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: When are they coming?</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Tomorrow. Harry has an account to work on today. Yes, he does have Richard&#39;s eyes. Big blue eyes. The baby even looks at you like Richard does.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Well, children usually resemble their parents.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: It&#39;s true Michelle is a lot like Harry in so many ways. And she&#39;s shy with new people, just like he is.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: You really like Michelle, don&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Yes. I&#39;m very fond of her.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: And Harry, too?</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Well...</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Uh, it&#39;s four-thirty. Oh, my! Marilyn and Richard will be home from the hospital any minute, and we must prepare this room.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Where will we put all the presents?</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Well, let&#39;s take everything to the living room. Marilyn and Richard and the baby need the space. It&#39;s crowded in here.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: The welcome sign is up: &quot;Welcome home, Max.&quot;</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Isn&#39;t it exciting, Grandpa?</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Your first great-grandchild.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Yes. Yes, sir. A great-grandchild. A great-grandson. Another generation to carry on the Stewart name.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: I love you, Grandpa. You make me feel so proud to be part of our family.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: One day, you&#39;ll have your own family, and I&#39;ll be proud to be part of it.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Now you understand my feelings, Susan. I&#39;m Grandpa&#39;s daughter-in-law, but I feel like a Stewart. He&#39;s always made me feel like his own daughter.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Well, that&#39;s because you&#39;re so much like us-wonderful!</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Mom, got it. This will make a nice gift for Marilyn and dates and information about Max&#39;s life here. Let&#39;s see. Name: Max Stewart. Does he have a middle name?</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: No, just Max. I like that. No middle name. No middle initial.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Like me. I&#39;m Malcolm Stewart. Just Malcolm Stewart.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: And Max has your initials, Grandpa: M.S.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Uh, it must mean something.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Weight: eight pounds six ounces.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Eight-six. Big boy! All the Stewart men were big.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Well, Robbie was eight pounds two ounces, and Richard was eight pounds three.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: And me?</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Eight pounds six. You were big, just like Max.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Eight pounds six, just like me. That&#39;s nice. Length. Length?</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Richard says Max is twenty-one inches long.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Tall. All the Stewart men are tall.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Well, Grandpa, you&#39;re about five-nine or five-ten. I wouldn&#39;t call that tall.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: I take after my mother&#39;s family. They were...they were... they were average.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Mother: Marilyn</p><p><strong>Father</strong>: Richard And lots of pages for Richard&#39;s photos of Max.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Speaking of mother and of father-and speaking of Max hear the car. They&#39;re here!</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Oh! Oh, quickly! Go, go, go!</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Let&#39;s see. Oh, welcome home. Oh, let her in. Wait with your pictures for a second. Come on, darlings. Sweetheart... Sit down right here.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Oh, he&#39;s so cute! Oh, Marilyn!</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Max looks just like Grandpa.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: A real Stewart.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: I&#39;m so happy to be home with my family - and with Max.</p><h2 id="act-2" tabindex="-1">Act 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#act-2" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Act 2&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Susan</strong>: It&#39;s almost ten o&#39;clock. I&#39;ve got to go. Tomorrow is Monday, and work begins at eight in the morning for me. Oh, I&#39;m so happy that Max is home. He&#39;s the sweetest little thing.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: I&#39;ll drive you to Grand Grandpa, Robbie, and I can finish wrapping all these gifts.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: It&#39;s so good to have you home again...and to see Max asleep in his bassinet at home with us.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: To be with our family and all that Stewart TLC.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: TLC-tender loving care. That&#39;s our motto.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Did you see the washcloth and the towels with the teddy bears on them? Alexandra and the Molinas sent them for Max.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: It was so kind of them. Now Max has come into everyone&#39;s life.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: The house is so alive with him here. The welcome sign over the door. The boxes of presents. The M-A-X over his bassinet. Robbie put that there. Susan&#39;s teddy bear. So cuddly. The beautiful crib from Mom and Dad.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Oh, and Grandpa&#39;s baseball glove. You know, it hung over my crib, too. And it hung over Robbie&#39;s crib.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Part of Grandpa&#39;s magic?</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Oh, that&#39;s not all. It hung over Susan&#39;s crib.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: The same baseball glove?</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: That&#39;s right. Grandpa hangs it there for good luck. He says it always brought him good luck on the baseball team. He believes it&#39;ll bring good luck to all the Stewart babies.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: And then he takes it back when Max is ready to use it?</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Yes, and replaces it with a new glove so the old one will be ready for a new member of the Stewart family.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Grandpa really loves his family, doesn&#39;t he? So do I.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: And so do I.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: And so does Max.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: After he eats!</p><h2 id="act-3" tabindex="-1">Act 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#act-3" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Act 3&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Thanks, Michelle.</p><p><strong>Michelle</strong>: I hope you like it.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Isn&#39;t this baby outfit adorable? With his name on it &quot;Max.&quot; Thanks so much, Harry and Michelle.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: We really appreciate it.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: I&#39;m glad you like it. Michelle picked it out.</p><p><strong>Michelle</strong>: Yes. I told Daddy to pick blue ones. Blue is for boys, and pink is for girls.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: And Max is some boy.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: He&#39;s a real Stewart.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Right!</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: That was so thoughtful of you, Michelle. Especially to pick it out in blue.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Would you like to see baby Max, Michelle?</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: Could she? Could we?</p><p><strong>Michelle</strong>: Could I?</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Take them upstairs, Susan. Harry and Michelle can watch Max sleeping.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Let&#39;s go.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: Come on, Michelle. Before Max wakes up.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Will you please take this upstairs, Susan?</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Uh-huh.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Thank you.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Michelle is very grown up for a ten-year-old, huh?</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: She&#39;s smart and sensitive for her age.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Growing up without a mother is difficult. You mature quickly.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Susan&#39;s like a mother to Michelle. They have a good relationship. Do you think Susan and Harry will get married?</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Yeah. You can count on it.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: I think so. Yes. They get along so well.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: I like him. He&#39;s good for Susan.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: He&#39;s a little quiet.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: It&#39;s hard to do anything but listen in this family.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: How can anybody get a word in around here?</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: You&#39;re right, Ellen.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Oh, really?</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: It&#39;s the way it should be. The Stewarts are the Stewarts!</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: They always were, and they always will be.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Right!</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: They&#39;ve always got an opinion. Always got something to say.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: And now there&#39;s Max Stewart, and if he talks as loudly as he cries, we&#39;re all in for trouble.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: He&#39;s quiet now.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Mmm-hmm. That&#39;s because he&#39;s sleeping.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: He&#39;s really cute.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: It&#39;s not necessary to whisper, Harry. A baby gets used to voices.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: I remember now. We always whispered when Michelle was born.</p><p><strong>Michelle</strong>: And I didn&#39;t sleep well. Daddy told me. I never slept. And when I did, I woke up when I heard someone speak.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: I bet you were cute.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: She sure was.</p><p><strong>Michelle</strong>: Not as cute as Max. He&#39;s like a little doll.</p><p><strong>Michelle</strong>: Oh, good. Now I can help diaper him.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Let&#39;s get Marilyn. What do you do when he cries like that?</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: You pick him up.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: He&#39;s so little...so new. Let&#39;s call Marilyn.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Time for a feeding and time for a diapering. You&#39;re a real Stewart.</p>',122),a=[s];function l(i,p,g,h,d,u){return o(),t("div",null,a)}const m=e(r,[["render",l]]);export{c as __pageData,m as default};
