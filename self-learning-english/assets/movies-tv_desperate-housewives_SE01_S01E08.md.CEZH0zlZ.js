It was an accident!</p><p>We have to get rid of the car.</p><p>But we can’t sell it.</p><p>The police might find it and there could be D.N.A.</p><p>We’ll take it to a bad part of town, we’ll leave the keys in the ignition and the doors unlocked.</p><p>If the police don’t find it we’ll get the insurance money.</p><p>And if they do, it wasn’t in our possession.</p><p>Anyone could have hit Mrs. Solis.</p><p>That sounds good.</p><p>Bree, are you sure?</p><p>Our son could spend the rest of his life in jail.</p><p>I won’t allow that.</p><p>Bree knew what she was about to do was wrong.</p><p>But like most sinners, she would worry about her guilt tomorrow.</p><p>Everybody should go wash up.</p><p>We’re having pancakes for breakfast.</p><p>Not since my own suicide had violence intruded upon the serenity of life on Wisteria Lane in such a conspicuous fashion.</p><p>Needless to say, my friends attacked the problem head-on.</p><p>Lynette brought the broom, Susan brought the trash bags, and Bree brought the industrial strength solvent.</p><p>Whoo. That stuff is strong.</p><p>It has to be. I don’t want Gabrielle and Carlos coming home to this ugly reminder in front of their house.</p><p>Has anyone been over there?</p><p>Julie and I went over this morning.</p><p>How’s Juanita doing?</p><p>She’s in a coma ever since she came out of the E.R..</p><p>Nobody knows when or even if she’ll wake up.</p><p>This is awful. Carlos must be just devastated.</p><p>I hope she wakes up so maybe she can tell us who was driving that car.</p><p>We can only hope.</p><p>Slow down, you jerk! This is a residential neighborhood!</p><p>That’s quite a pitching arm you’ve got there.</p><p>It pisses me off. I’ve got four kids.</p><p>I was up all night reading statistics online.</p><p>One out of every four traffic accidents happens on residential streets.</p><p>I hope whoever hit Juanita gets put away for life.</p><p>Don’t you think that’s a little bit extreme?</p><p>An innocent woman gets hit by a car and the driver takes off? I don’t think it’s extreme.</p><p>You should go home and get some rest. Eat something.</p><p>You have ton of messages from work.</p><p>Tanaka called. Said it was urgent.</p><p>Carlos, I can stay here with your mother.</p><p>I need to be here if she wakes up.</p><p>You can’t go on like this.You have to take care of yourself.</p><p>And what if she dies?</p><p>People slip into comas all the time and never come out.</p><p>Don’t say that. We need to stay positive.</p><p>- Mr. and Mrs. Solis. - John.</p><p>- Is it ok if I come in? - Of course.</p><p>Mr. Solis, I’m so sorry this happened.</p><p>It means a lot that you came.</p><p>I think I’m gonna go down to the chapel and pray.</p><p>You wanna come?</p><p>No. I think I will stay here with mama.</p><p>- Is it all right if I come? - Of course.</p><p>We need all the prayers we can get.</p><p>Mrs. Solis, it’s time for her sponge bath.</p><p>Come again?</p><p>Sometimes family members prefer to administer sponge baths themselves.</p><p>I think I’ll pass.</p><p>Martha.</p><p>- Where’s your purse? - Over there. Why?</p><p>What are you doing?</p><p>I am taking back the $ 40 you stole out of my purse.</p><p>- Edie! - We both know you did it. Now hand it over!</p><p>I have taken nothing from your purse.</p><p>If you’re missing money, I’d ask one of those strange men you parade through here at all hours.</p><p>I am not going to apologize for having a healthy sex life.</p><p>Healthy? I’m going to have to burn every sheet you’ve touched.</p><p>- I want my money. - And I want those non-fat peach yogurts.</p><p>They didn’t just walk out of that fridge by themselves.</p><p>You can deduct it from the $ 40 that you’re going to give me now.</p><p>You’re my best friend. Why would I steal from you?</p><p>It’s no secret that you’ve been having financial problems.</p><p>I hear you bitching on the phone to your bank.</p><p>that’s it.</p><p>I can put up with your debauchery and your food theft, but I will not tolerate spying.</p><p>- I want you out. - You don’t mean that.</p><p>Oh, yes, I do. I’m leaving tomorrow to visit my sister for a few days.</p><p>I want you gone by the time I get back.</p><p>I’ll do you one better.</p><p>I will leave today.</p><p>I hope this works.</p><p>My sleep cycle’s totally out of whack.</p><p>I’m up all night, then dozing off during the day.</p><p>Trust me. This will do the trick.</p><p>In fact, you should be feeling more relaxed already.</p><p>You know, you’re right.</p><p>Boys, I can hear you out there!</p><p>Now be quiet! Just sit there and color.</p><p>- Now is not a good time to be moving. - I’m sorry.</p><p>Just block everything out and let it go.</p><p>Imagine that you’re in a forest.</p><p>There’s a babbling brook nearby.</p><p>And the wind is just coming through the trees...</p><p>- Mommy? - Parker!</p><p>I don’t know... ow! ...what you think you’re doing, but put that back where it belongs.</p><p>Sorry. You were saying something about wind.</p><p>I was just creating a soothing image.</p><p>Oh, for the love of god.</p><p>Knock it off, you little monsters.</p><p>Mrs. Scavo, please lie down. We need to finish this.</p><p>I’m on my last nerves, so I’m gonna level with you here.</p><p>I’ve screwed up my entire system by taking my kids’ A.D.D. Medication.</p><p>Yeah, that’s right, you heard me. I plan to stop.</p><p>But right now I need to sleep and I need more than a few crappy needles, so what do you got?</p><p>I’m not licensed to write prescriptions.</p><p>I know you’re not.</p><p>This will put you right to sleep.</p><p>It’s a very powerful herbal remedy.</p><p>Promise me you’ll use it judiciously.</p><p>Sure. Whatever.</p><p>Knock, knock!</p><p>- Hey, come on in. - You’re a mess.</p><p>I’m tearing out the leaky pipes in the upstairs bathroom.</p><p>Wall-to-wall rotten wood.</p><p>Sounds like a job.</p><p>So Julie said that you came by before.</p><p>Um... Yeah.</p><p>I was thinking about driving up to the Germani Vineyard tomorrow for this wine tasting and...</p><p>What time do you want me to be ready?</p><p>- About 6:00. - Six is good.</p><p>All right.</p><p>I thought maybe afterwards we could have a little dinner, maybe some dancing.</p><p>Sounds great.</p><p>You do know that it’s like a two-hour drive up there.</p><p>And isn’t that kind of late to be coming back?</p><p>I thought if worse came to worse we could... grab a room.</p><p>Oh? Like a hotel room?</p><p>- Yeah. As a last resort. - Of course. Of course. Yes.</p><p>So maybe we should make a reservation.</p><p>You know, just in case.</p><p>Yeah, I found some hotels online.</p><p>Let me get the print-out.</p><p>Hey, Bongo. Come here. Do you want a treat?</p><p>- Where do you keep the dog biscuits? - Sorry, what?</p><p>Oh, never mind.</p><p>We’ll just find them ourselves, huh?</p><p>I’m sorry, Susan. I couldn’t hear you. What did you say?</p><p>Nothing. It’s not important.</p><p>It’s my tiler guy. Here. See what looks good.</p><p>Hey, Phil.</p><p>No, tomorrow morning I’m making a lumber run.</p><p>That’s no good.</p><p>No, I’m gone tomorrow night, too.</p><p>- I could let him in. - No, it’s ok. Thanks.</p><p>It’s fine.</p><p>Just give me the key. I’ll be around all day.</p><p>All right. Thanks.</p><p>Phil, I’ll give a key to my neighbor.</p><p>She’ll be here to let you in.</p><p>Like every city, fairview had a neighborhood that was less than desirable.</p><p>It was an accepted fact anyone who lingered there after midnight was usually up to no good.</p><p>Rex and Bree Van de Kamp were no exception.</p><p>You really think this is gonna work?</p><p>This is an impoverished neighborhood in the city.</p><p>Trust me. Somebody will steal the car.</p><p>How can you be so sure?</p><p>Because I have faith in the poor.</p><p>She’s so beautiful.</p><p>I shot this last year on her birthday.</p><p>How are you going to do it?</p><p>I made contact with her at a bar.</p><p>She thinks I’m a real-estate developer.</p><p>- Is she going to suffer? - No.</p><p>Edie Britt will disappear and you’ll go back to your life.</p><p>Before you do it, do you think you could ask her why she sent this to my wife?</p><p>You can’t think like that, Mr. Young.</p><p>You can’t give in to your curiosity.</p><p>Curiosity leads to guilt.</p><p>Guilt leads to talking.</p><p>Do you still have questions?</p><p>I want to be clear about something.</p><p>If I walk away with this cash, it’s done.</p><p>No refunds. No buyer’s remorse.</p><p>I get it.</p><p>We won’t talk again, so I’ll ask one more time.</p><p>Are you sure you want this?</p><p>My wife is dead because of Edie Britt.</p><p>I absolutely want this.</p><p>You’ve been awfully quiet.</p><p>I’ve just been thinking about the kids.</p><p>They sure grew up quickly, didn’t they?</p><p>They sure did.</p><p>I told them when they were babies that they weren’t allowed to get any bigger because they were so adorable.</p><p>- And we were so happy. - Yeah, well...</p><p>They sure didn’t turn out like we expected them to.</p><p>No. They didn’t.</p><p>Oh, we could have been better parents.</p><p>We weren’t that bad.</p><p>We still have so much to teach them.</p><p>We need to show Andrew the enormity of what he’s done.</p><p>I suppose we could punish him.</p><p>What’s the appropriate punishment for a child who drives over a woman?</p><p>I don’t know.</p><p>No matter how the kids turn out, I still love them.</p><p>Course you do.</p><p>But I’ll never forgive them for growing up so quickly.</p><p>Hey, look.</p><p>And I opened the cabinet and there was all this money in it.</p><p>I mean there was wads of it.</p><p>That’s why you’re freaking out?</p><p>A few stacks of cash? Come on.</p><p>Realistically, I’ve known this guy a few weeks.</p><p>He could be a hit man for the mob.</p><p>If you really think that why are you going on a trip with him?</p><p>I never get out of the house.</p><p>Mom. If you really need something to freak out about, just remember that you’re spending the night with Mike.</p><p>No man has seen you naked in years.</p><p>Except your doctor.</p><p>And he retired.</p><p>I try not to take that personally.</p><p>You look old in that.</p><p>Maybe I am being silly.</p><p>But going to a hotel with a man is a big deal to me.</p><p>What if Mike is hiding something?</p><p>- Like what? - I don’t know.</p><p>That’s dad. I gotta go.</p><p>Now, listen to me. No more freaking out.</p><p>I need this weekend to go well.</p><p>Why do you care so much?</p><p>Because I’m gonna have a husband some day.</p><p>I really don’t want you living with us.</p><p>- Are the Lady Fingers ok? - They’re terrific.</p><p>We just appreciate you all stopping by.</p><p>We just wanted you to know how much we care.</p><p>So have the police come up with any leads?</p><p>Not really. They’ll be able to determine the make and model of the car, but without any eyewitnesses, no one seems very optimistic.</p><p>More importantly is there any good news about Juanita?</p><p>No change.</p><p>All we can do is wait and hope for the best.</p><p>We put her on our prayer list at church.</p><p>That’s very sweet, Danielle. Thank you.</p><p>It must really help during times like these, having kids.</p><p>Yeah. They’re a blessing.</p><p>Children make everything worthwhile.</p><p>You guys are the future. Legacy.</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>After we’re all dead, you’ll be the only ones left to carry on.</p><p>Gabrielle and I are about to start a family.</p><p>Oh! Hey, that’s great!</p><p>When did you decide this?</p><p>It’s a fairly recent development.</p><p>I see.</p><p>We’ll talk about this later.</p><p>Face it. We’re shallow people.</p><p>Can our lives have any meaning if all we do is buy stuff?</p><p>- That depends on what we buy. - I want a child.</p><p>In case you’ve forgotten, before we fot married we made a deal. No kids.</p><p>Deals were meant to be renegotiated.</p><p>We’re not negotiating my uterus.</p><p>We should probably be going.</p><p>Thank you so much.</p><p>- That was weird. - I feel awful for Carlos.</p><p>That talk about children is obviously coming from his grief.</p><p>Whatever. I’m off the hook.</p><p>A weary Lynette drank her potent tea in hopes of finally finding the sleep that had eluded her.</p><p>Unfortunately for Lynette, there would be no rest for the weary.</p><p>Go to hell.</p><p>Go to hell, go to hell.</p><p>Sorry we’re late.</p><p>Kenny Lipman couldn’t find his neckerchief.</p><p>Come on guys Lori Jean, the scout meeting is today?</p><p>- Mommy! - What? Oh. Right.</p><p>Ok. Boys. This knot is called the bowline.</p><p>It is a remarkably useful knot. Now, pick up your ropes.</p><p>Ok, first we cross this end over here and then we make a loop and then another loop And then you sort of pull it through, I’m guessing, and then you just... ready? ...Yank it taut.</p><p>Mommy, that doesn’t look like the picture.</p><p>You’re never gonna be a sailor. What do you care?</p><p>Ok, everybody. Let’s just take a break.</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>Ok. It’s all up there. Can I get a signature?</p><p>- Oh, of course. - Thank you very much.</p><p>- There you go. Have a nice weekend. - You too, lady.</p><p>Hey, ma’am!</p><p>Are you still here? I forgot to give you a receipt.</p><p>Ma’am?</p><p>Hello!</p><p>I need help! I’m up here!</p><p>I’m trapped in the floor! hello!</p><p>If you came in here to judge me, you can just leave.</p><p>Wait! Wait, no! Wait. Don’t go.</p><p>Wait. I have an idea. Here, here, here.</p><p>Here. Grab the towel, Bongo.</p><p>Come on. Grab the other end. Good boy.</p><p>That’s it. Get the other end.</p><p>Come on, Bongo. Pull the other end.</p><p>Come on, Bongo. What are you doing? Bongo, over here.</p><p>Bongo? Oh! Oh! Don’t do that! Oh, Bongo!</p><p>While Susan remained hopelessly stuck, Gabrielle was moving to confront the issue of her young lover’s restless conscience.</p><p>Nobody’s home.</p><p>I know. I’ve been watching. I came to talk to you.</p><p>- Although she would need to be discreet. - Keep working.</p><p>What were you thinking showing up at the hospital?</p><p>I had to see if she was ok.</p><p>You need to keep a low profile right now.</p><p>Look, you and I are finished.</p><p>From now on, I’m sticking with Danielle.</p><p>Why would you say that?</p><p>I hate myself for what we did.</p><p>Ok, I can’t sleep at night. We’ve got to make a clean break.</p><p>We weren’t driving the car.</p><p>We didn’t chase Juanita into the street.</p><p>She wouldn’t have been there if we weren’t having an affair.</p><p>Oh, for god sake. Between you and Carlos!</p><p>Listen to me carefully. You didn’t do anything wrong.</p><p>- That’s not what father Crowley thinks. - What?</p><p>I went to confession.</p><p>Have you lost your mind? What did you tell him?</p><p>- Everything? - Including...</p><p>in the alley? Behind the truck stop?</p><p>- Everything. - Damn you!</p><p>What is wrong with you?</p><p>Lassie would have had a fire truck here by now.</p><p>You stupid dog.</p><p>Good boy, Bongo! Run, Bongo, Run! Go get help!</p><p>Andrew, um...</p><p>I know the last few days have been stressful.</p><p>And you know, if you ever need to talk to anybody...</p><p>I know. You and Dad are here for me.</p><p>Actually, I was thinking we could arrange for you to talk to a professional.</p><p>A shrink?</p><p>- You think I’m crazy? - Of course not.</p><p>It’s just that the accident probably stirred up a lot of emotions.</p><p>And it would be normal for you to be feeling confused or depressed or shamed.</p><p>I’m cool. Really.</p><p>Honey. You put a woman into a coma.</p><p>Surely that arouses some kind of emotion.</p><p>Yeah, well, it doesn’t.</p><p>If you’ll excuse me.</p><p>No! I won’t. Not until you tell me.</p><p>Why do you care?</p><p>I need to know you’re not a monster.</p><p>- You want to know how I feel? - Yeah.</p><p>Here goes. I feel bad that she got hurt.</p><p>But I also feel bad that my car got dinged Because somebody didn’t have the sense to look both ways before she cross the street.</p><p>And I feel bad that now I’m gonna have to ride my bike to school.</p><p>Andrew, you almost killed another human being.</p><p>She’s an old lady, ok? She’s lived her life.</p><p>I have my whole life ahead of me and now it might be screwed up.</p><p>That’s what you should be worried about.</p><p>What I’m worried about is that Andrew you don’t seem to have a soul.</p><p>Give me one good reason why I shouldn’t call the police.</p><p>Because I’m your son. That would make you the monster.</p><p>Hey, buddy.</p><p>Susan, is that you?</p><p>Mike? I’m upstairs. Sort of.</p><p>Hang on. I’ll be right up.</p><p>What happened?</p><p>Well, you see. This bird flew in your bathroom window and I tried to save it but uh... it died.</p><p>I don’t think that’s what happened.</p><p>I don’t think so either.</p><p>- Help me get out of here please. - Come on.</p><p>Oh! God.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Oh. You have no idea what that was like. Oh.</p><p>- You went through my cabinets? - What?</p><p>- Oh, I can explain that. - Get out of my house.</p><p>- Mike... - Get out.</p><p>- Hello there! - Good afternoon.</p><p>Oh! Well, isn’t this just as pretty as a picture book?</p><p>The plan is to put in a small condo.</p><p>You want to make some money or you want to pussyfoot around?</p><p>What do you suggest?</p><p>I’m thinking? Strip mall.</p><p>I’ve run some numbers - Nice stationery. - Oh, it’s stolen.</p><p>What do you mean?</p><p>After my house burned down, I was staying with this neighbour Martha Huber.</p><p>That is until the old troll threw me out.</p><p>Anyway. I’d steal her stuff, she’d steal mine It’s the circle of life.</p><p>So this paper is hers?</p><p>Oh, god, Yes.</p><p>No, Tom, you can’t do this to me.</p><p>Because I need you home!</p><p>Boys, stop it! I am on the phone!</p><p>Well. Yeah, I realize it’s not your fault that the meeting got postponed But you promised you’d be back tonight.</p><p>- Mom! - I gotta go.</p><p>The kids are... Yeah.</p><p>I know you’re sorry.</p><p>Just will you try and get back as soon as you can?</p><p>Ok. Bye.</p><p>Boys, would you please, please stop it?</p><p>Really. Mommy’s got a headache, ok? Just...</p><p>Turn that damn thing off!</p><p>What’s the matter with you? Why won’t you listen to me?</p><ul><li>All is groovy * _ Slow down, you move too fast _ _ You’ve got to make the morning last _ _ Just kicking down the cobbled stones _ _ Looking for fun and feeling groovy _ What?</li></ul><p>I just came over to say I’m sorry.</p><p>And I’ll pay for all the damage.</p><p>Don’t worry about it.</p><p>Well... So...</p><p>In your mind, is the date off?</p><p>Well. You snooped around my house and went through my stuff.</p><p>Yeah. That’s pretty much a deal breaker.</p><p>Hold on a minute. I started snooping around because I found all that money by accident.</p><p>And then I found a gun.</p><p>- Are you a drug dealer? - Is that what you think?</p><p>I wouldn’t know because you never let me in.</p><p>You know this whole part of your life that you kept completely walled off.</p><p>I have a gun for protection. I keep cash for emergencies.</p><p>I’m a good guy, Susan, and you should know that.</p><p>I’m not obligated to share every little detail of my life...</p><p>Every little detail is one thing, weird creepy secrets, that’s another.</p><p>You know what, I don’t wanna be with somebody who doesn’t trust me.</p><p>Well, maybe we shouldn’t be dating.</p><p>Maybe we shouldn’t.</p><p>- Do you mean that? - Yeah.</p><p>Well, I hope that your, you know, little secret keeps you warm at night.</p><p>Because you’re throwing something really great away to protect it.</p><p>Oh, Susan! You gotta take my kids for a while.</p><p>Lynette, this just really isn’t a good time.</p><p>No, no I’m sorry but I can’t do this.</p><p>It’s just, it’s too much.</p><p>Boys, you stay with your aunt Susan.</p><p>Lynette, when are you coming back?</p><p>Lynette!</p><p>Lynette!</p><p>There’s Lynette’s car. She’s gotta be close.</p><p>I hope the kids aren’t too much for Danielle to handle.</p><p>She’ll be fine.</p><p>What do you think is happening with Lynette?</p><p>I don’t know. But I’m scared.</p><p>Something’s very, very wrong.</p><p>Lynette? Honey?</p><p>Are you ok?</p><p>Father. I’m so glad you could come and pray for mama.</p><p>- Please, sit. - Thank you, Gabrielle.</p><p>Listen, since you’re here.</p><p>There’s something I’ve always wondered about.</p><p>That whole thing about priests not being allowed to repeat what they hear in confessions.</p><p>Is that a hard rule or just a general guideline?</p><p>Rest assured, everyone’s secrets are safe.</p><p>That’s good to hear.</p><p>I’ll keep yours too if you want to talk.</p><p>Me? No, no. Confession’s not really my thing.</p><p>That’s a shame.</p><p>Ok, you can stop condemning me with your eyes.</p><p>Right now.</p><p>I know you know about the affair.</p><p>But you know nothing about my life.</p><p>Look, it’s not even an issue any more.</p><p>John and I are finished.</p><p>Gabrielle, the church is pretty clear on this.</p><p>If you commit a mortal sin and you die without repenting, You go to hell.</p><p>Well, aren’t you just a ball of fun?</p><p>So if I confess, it’ll clean the slate, right?</p><p>Not only that.</p><p>If you want god’s forgiveness you have to be truly sorry and promise not to commit the sin again.</p><p>So what happens if I repent later?</p><p>Like, say, when I’m 75?</p><p>I wouldn’t recommend waiting, what if you die before then?</p><p>Well, let’s say I don’t die?</p><p>I do yoga. I eat well.</p><p>If I wait, does my repenting still count?</p><p>If you mean it, yes.</p><p>Thank you, Father Crowley.</p><p>You have been a tremendous comfort.</p><p>Um... I will let you do your thing.</p><p>Gabrielle.</p><p>We’re all responsible for the choices we make.</p><p>Don’t you want to be a good person?</p><p>What I want is to be happy.</p><p>That’s the answer of a selfish child.</p><p>I know.</p><p>Then I started taking the pills because they gave me energy but then I couldn’t sleep at night and I was so tired in the daytime and...</p><p>It totally messed me up.</p><p>I love my kids so much.</p><p>I’m so sorry they have me as a mother.</p><p>Lynette, you’re a great mother.</p><p>No, I’m not.</p><p>I can’t do it.</p><p>I’m so tired of feeling like a failure. It’s so humiliating.</p><p>No, it’s not!</p><p>So you got addicted to your kids’ ADD Medication.</p><p>It happens.</p><p>You’ve got four kids. That’s a lot of stress and you just need some help.</p><p>That’s what’s so humiliating.</p><p>Other moms don’t need help.</p><p>Other moms make it look so easy.</p><p>All I do is complain.</p><p>That’s just not true!</p><p>When Julie was a baby, I was out of my mind almost every day.</p><p>I got so upset when Andrew and Danielle were little, I used their nap times to cry.</p><p>Why didn’t you ever tell me this?</p><p>Oh, baby.
