Find a way to relax.</p><p>- Gabrielle... - Get here as fast as you can.</p><p>found herself a playmate.</p><p>Lynette couldn’t get her kids to stop playing.</p><p>Ma’am do you know why I pulled you over?</p><p>I have a theory.</p><p>If I don’t get some sleep, I’ll be forced back upstairs out of exhaustion.</p><p>And Bree played hard ball.</p><p>Everyone has a little dirty laundry.</p><p>When I was alive, I maintained many different identities.</p><p>Lover, wife and, ultimately, victim.</p><p>Yes, labels are important to the living.</p><p>They dictate how people see themselves.</p><p>Like my friend Lynette.</p><p>She used to see herself as a career woman, and a hugely successful one.</p><p>She was known for her power lunches, her eye-catching presentations, and her ruthlessness in wiping out the competition.</p><p>But Lynette gave up her career to assume a new label.</p><p>The incredibly satisfying role of full-time mother.</p><p>Scavo residence. Yes, this is me.</p><p>But, unfortunately for Lynette, this new label frequently fell short of what was advertised.</p><p>How in the world did they...?</p><p>I left the door to the art supply cupboard open for five minutes.</p><p>- That’s all. - Five minutes.</p><p>The little girl, why didn’t she say anything?</p><p>Your boys work quickly.</p><p>Well, obviously they will be punished for this severely.</p><p>I hesitate bringing this up, since you got so ugly about it last time...</p><p>They don’t have attention deficit disorder, and I won’t drug my boys just to make your job easier.</p><p>I’d rather change teachers.</p><p>The boys are in my class because I’m the only teacher who can handle them.</p><p>What if we separate the twins, put them in different classes?</p><p>They’re much calmer when they’re not bouncing off one another.</p><p>We can try that, but if it doesn’t work, we may no longer be able to accommodate them.</p><p>It suddenly occurred to Lynette, her label was about to change yet again.</p><p>And for the next few years, she would be known as the mother of the boys who painted Tiffany Axelrod blue.</p><p>It looked to be an interesting afternoon on Wisteria Lane.</p><p>A mysterious cassette tape had been discovered by my friend Bree.</p><p>She had stolen it from her marriage counselor.</p><p>A counselor I’d once spoken to in strictest confidence.</p><p>So how have you been?</p><p>I had the nightmare again.</p><p>It’s weird to hear Mary Alice.</p><p>- Still the same one? - Yes.</p><p>But this time I was standing in a river and I saw the girl under the water.</p><p>She kept screaming ”Angela” over and over again.</p><p>What do you think the significance of the name ”Angela” is?</p><p>Actually, that’s my real name.</p><p>Her real name?</p><p>That doesn’t make any sense.</p><p>I’ve seen her driver’s license. I did not say Angela.</p><p>Bree, what does it say in the rest of the tape?</p><p>Just more about her nightmares, and this girl she was afraid of.</p><p>So what the hell do we do now?</p><p>I think we should show Paul the note.</p><p>Are you sure? He’s gonna freak.</p><p>It’s now or never.</p><p>I saw what he’s asking for the place.</p><p>It’s gonna sell quickly.</p><p>Can I say something?</p><p>- I’m glad Paul’s moving. - Gaby.</p><p>I’m sorry. He’s just always given my the creeps.</p><p>Haven’t you guys noticed, he has this dark thing going on?</p><p>Something about him just feels...</p><p>- Malignant? - Yes.</p><p>We’ve all sort of felt it.</p><p>That being said, I do love what he’s done with that lawn.</p><p>Mom, the dish is clean.</p><p>I still don’t understand why you don’t just ask him out on an official date date.</p><p>I’m trying a new strategy. I’m playing hard to get.</p><p>How long do you think you can keep that up?</p><p>Maybe until noon.</p><p>Then I’m going to have to run over there and beg him to love me.</p><p>Uh, mom, I don’t think you’re gonna be able to wait that long.</p><p>You got to be kidding. She washed her car yesterday.</p><p>Oh, no, she’s not.</p><p>Yep, she’s bringing out the big guns.</p><p>You better get over there. She’s wearing cotton.</p><p>What am I supposed to say? ”I saw you half-naked and I thought I’d drop by”?</p><p>What’s that?</p><p>A piece of Mike’s junk mail we got by mistake.</p><p>I held onto it in case of an emergency.</p><p>God bless you.</p><p>Hey, Susan.</p><p>We got this by mistake.</p><p>Oh, thanks.</p><p>I hope it’s not important.</p><p>No, it’s just a promotion for the Rialto Film Festival.</p><p>Well, I guess I’ve done my good deed for the day.</p><p>I’ll just head back home.</p><p>Bye.</p><p>- Hey, you like old movies? - I love old movies.</p><p>I hate Susan Mayer.</p><p>Every time I see those big doe eyes of hers, I swear to god I just want to go out and shoot a deer.</p><p>What has she done this time?</p><p>She is out there throwing herself at Mike Delfino, again.</p><p>Susan likes Mike?</p><p>Where the hell have you been, Martha?</p><p>She’s been lusting after him ever since he moved in.</p><p>I got your message. What’s going on?</p><p>The boys refuse to be separated.</p><p>They refuse? They’re six years old. Make them.</p><p>The school regulations are pretty strict about me wrestling with the boys.</p><p>But if you want to give it a shot, be my guest.</p><p>Fine.</p><p>Oh, which one goes and which one stays?</p><p>You pick.</p><p>Come on now. Stop it! No. No.</p><p>I’m gonna take the whole table. That’s right.</p><p>Come on now. I mean it.</p><p>I love taking baths. Especially with you.</p><p>It’s like taking a vacation from the world.</p><p>I hated taking baths when I was a kid.</p><p>Of course, back then, the only thing I had to play with was my rubber ducky.</p><p>Who’s that?</p><p>It’s Mr. Solis.</p><p>Relax. Carlos is at work and he doesn’t ring the doorbell.</p><p>It’s the cable guy. He’s three hours late.</p><p>Use the side entrance.</p><p>Gabrielle knew her vacation from the world had ended.</p><p>What she didn’t know was John had left behind a souvenir.</p><p>I’m telling dad didn’t come home last night.</p><p>- They had a fight. A bad one. - How bad?</p><p>Like divorce court bad.</p><p>Listen to her.</p><p>She always overcompensates when she’s worried.</p><p>If dad moves out and leaves us with her, I’ll lose my mind.</p><p>Dinner is on the table.</p><p>Mom, where did dad go last night?</p><p>He got a last minute call to speak at a medical conference in Philadelphia.</p><p>Take your seats.</p><p>This marriage is so over.</p><p>Andrew?</p><p>Again sorry I was late.</p><p>The scheduler overbooked me.</p><p>- How long are you going to be? - Almost done.</p><p>What is that scent? Is that sage and citrus?</p><p>That’s amazing.</p><p>Try to hurry. I have stuff to do.</p><p>Come on.</p><p>What’s happening?</p><p>The cable guy fell.</p><p>He hit his head on the tub. He may have a concussion.</p><p>- It’s almost eight. - He was late.</p><p>Mrs. Huber.</p><p>Hello, Susan. I made you a pie.</p><p>Oh, wow! Why?</p><p>Do I need a motive to do something nice?</p><p>I can’t wait for you to try this.</p><p>It’s mincemeat.</p><p>Actually, I just had dinner.</p><p>That’s ok. You can save it for later.</p><p>What’s so funny?</p><p>I was just thinking of that expression, ”I’ll make mincemeat out of you”.</p><p>Mincemeat used to be an entrap of mostly chopped meat, so it was like saying, ”I’ll chop you up into little bits.” but that was centuries ago.</p><p>Today, mincemeat is mostly made of fruit, spices and rum.</p><p>There’s no meat in it and still people say, ”I’ll make mincemeat out of you.” I don’t know that people really say that anymore.</p><p>I do.</p><p>So, Susan, how are you?</p><p>I’m fine.</p><p>Good. You know, I have a confession to make.</p><p>I’ve always wish I’d been more supportive when Karl left you.</p><p>Oh, you don’t have to apologize about Karl.</p><p>Really, Karl and I are over.</p><p>- I’ve moved on. - Yes, I know.</p><p>You’ve moved on to that nice Mike Delfino.</p><p>He’s quite a catch, isn’t he?</p><p>You like him, don’t you?</p><p>Ah, sure, as a friend.</p><p>Oh, Susan.</p><p>Being coy is a strategy best employed by virgins at their first dance.</p><p>For women of our age, it’s just annoying.</p><p>You sure you don’t want pie?</p><p>No, thank you.</p><p>I hope it works out with you and Mike.</p><p>You’ve been so desperate to land him.</p><p>What? I am not desperate.</p><p>Good lord, Susan, you burned your rival’s house down.</p><p>If that isn’t desperate, I don’t know what is.</p><p>Mrs. Huber, with all due respect, you’re crazy.</p><p>- What’s that? - I think you recognize it.</p><p>I found it in the ruins of Eddie’s home.</p><p>- Well, that’s not... - Shh. My point is this.</p><p>I wasn’t there for you when Karl left, but I am here for you now.</p><p>As far as I’m concerned, this is our secret.</p><p>And no one ever need know.</p><p>Oh, Susan.</p><p>You don’t know how good it feels to finally be able to help you.</p><p>You look so pale.</p><p>Now, I insist you try some of my pie.</p><p>Go on.</p><p>Did I mention it’s mincemeat?</p><p>- Open the door, please. - Hang on.</p><p>- What? - May I come in?</p><p>- No. - I want to talk to you.</p><p>- Then talk. - Where were you last night?</p><p>- Brian’s. - I just spoke to Brian’s mother.</p><p>Tell me again where you were last night, and this time don’t lie to me.</p><p>Where did you say dad was again? In Philadelphia?</p><p>Andrew, don’t change the subject.</p><p>Sorry, I thought the subject was telling lies.</p><p>I called dad’s cell phone.</p><p>I know he moved out.</p><p>Well, it’s just temporary and...</p><p>...I thought it would upset you so I was protecting you.</p><p>Whatever. You lied.</p><p>So stop pretending like you have some sort of moral authority.</p><p>Andrew, just because I chose not to share my marital problems with you doesn’t give you the right to be rude.</p><p>How about driving my father away.</p><p>Do I get to be rude then?</p><p>What’s this?</p><p>- It’s a sock. - It’s a man’s sock.</p><p>I found it under our bed.</p><p>It’s not mine.</p><p>Oh, for god sakes, Carlos, it’s Yao Lin’s.</p><p>Our maid wears size 13 gym socks?</p><p>No, she dusts with them.</p><p>See? Socks instead of rags.</p><p>- Susan, hello. - Mrs. Huber.</p><p>Did you and Mike come together?</p><p>I saw him over in the fresh produce aisle.</p><p>No. Like I told you. We’re just friends.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>By the way, if I didn’t make it clear yesterday, I absolutely did not do that thing you accuse me of.</p><p>Hey, Susan. Hey, Mrs. Huber.</p><p>Nice to see you, Mike.</p><p>Hey. You like Alfred Hitchcock?</p><p>They’re doing a retrospective at the rialto.</p><p>Uh... ...I’m not really a fan.</p><p>Come on, how can you not like Hitchcock?</p><p>I just, uh, don’t.</p><p>Oh. Ok.</p><p>Well, uh, nice to see you.</p><p>You too, Mrs. Huber.</p><p>You’re so silly.</p><p>Pretending not to like him on my account.</p><p>I mean, really.</p><p>Will you just drop it?</p><p>You shouldn’t be rude to me.</p><p>Your secret is not an easy burden to bear.</p><p>That insurance company is putting Eddie through hell.</p><p>- But still I’ve said nothing. - Well...</p><p>The longer it takes for her payment, the longer she’ll be staying with me.</p><p>Eating me out of house and home. Using up my hot water.</p><p>What exactly is it you want from me, Mrs. Huber?</p><p>Are these together?</p><p>Ring it up.</p><p>If the school and the pediatrician think the twins could be medicated, then what’s the problem?</p><p>I used to run a company with 85 people, and now I can’t wrangle three small boys without doping them?</p><p>Talk about feeling like a failure.</p><p>Lynette, you are a great mother.</p><p>But, let’s face it, your kids are a challenge.</p><p>Thank you. That’s the nicest way you could’ve said that.</p><p>You know, the truth is when they’re not making me want to tear my hair out, they’re actually really sweet.</p><p>I’m afraid if I change the bad stuff, I’m going to change the good stuff.</p><p>It’s a tough call.</p><p>Like this mug.</p><p>I love this mug. If I medicate them, will they still make me a mug like this?</p><p>You know, it’s leaking.</p><p>Yeah, I know.</p><p>We talked to Paul. We told him we need to show him something.</p><p>He’s on his way over.</p><p>So, Paul, we notice that you’re selling the house.</p><p>Yes, too many painful memories. I’m sure you understand.</p><p>Before you move, we thought there’s something you should know.</p><p>It seems there may be more to Mary Alice’s death than you are aware of.</p><p>Remember when you asked us to pack her things?</p><p>Well, when we did, we found a note.</p><p>And we think that you should have it.</p><p>You can see from the postmark, Mary Alice probably got it the day she died.</p><p>- Paul, are you going to be okay? - No.</p><p>- Have you always cleaned with socks? - Yes.</p><p>What is that, a Japanese thing?</p><p>I am Chinese.</p><p>I don’t like lying.</p><p>I don’t like your ironing, so there.</p><p>Mrs. Solis, what are you doing here?</p><p>Carlos found this under the bed.</p><p>Oh, crap.</p><p>It’s ok. It was close call, but I managed to cover.</p><p>I got you these, so from now on, we can’t let Carlos see you wearing anything resembling a gym sock.</p><p>You want me to mow your lawn in sandals.</p><p>I could lose a toe.</p><p>Imagine what you’d lose if he finds out you’re trimming more than the hedge.</p><p>Why are your friends staring at me?</p><p>- Did you tell them about us? - No.</p><p>They’re staring ’cause they think you’re hot.</p><p>Oh... Ok.</p><p>It’s 9:30. What is your brother thinking?</p><p>Want my advice? Call dad.</p><p>Tell him to go kick Andrew’s ass.</p><p>I am perfectly capable of handling this without your father.</p><p>- I’m sorry. - Where’s your cell phone?</p><p>Call Andrew. Find out where he is.</p><p>He’ll know you’re behind this.</p><p>He won’t. Just act normal.</p><p>Hey, it’s me. Ah, what’s going on?</p><p>He knows.</p><p>Andrew, this is your mother.</p><p>I am rapidly reaching the end of my patience with you.</p><p>Where are you? Are you at a bar?</p><p>Andrew? Andrew?</p><p>- Mom? - He hung up on me.</p><p>What are you gonna do?</p><p>Heath. Lan. Andrew.</p><p>Mom, how did you even know I was here?</p><p>- You went in my room? - You think that’s bad?</p><p>Tomorrow morning, I’m cleaning it.</p><p>Oh, by the way, Heath.</p><p>I didn’t get a chance to tell you, that was a lovely solo last week at church.</p><p>Thank you. We’re out of here.</p><p>I hope it wasn’t something I said.</p><p>Well, Andrew, shall we?</p><p>You just humiliated me in front of my friends.</p><p>- I’m not going anywhere with you. - Fine.</p><p>- What are you doing? - I’m staying for the show.</p><p>I’m dying to see what all the fuss is about.</p><p>Excuse me, waitress. I’ll have a glass of your house Chardonnay.</p><p>Of course, ma’am.</p><p>I’m curious. Andrew, as you fantasize about this woman, do you ever stop and think how she came to be on this runway?</p><p>That’s someone’s little girl.</p><p>And that someone probably had a lot of dreams for her.</p><p>Dreams that did not include a thong and a pole.</p><p>It’s not going to work, ok? I’m not budging.</p><p>God knows what she’s had to deal with in life.</p><p>Abject poverty, drugs, domestic violence, maybe even molestation.</p><p>Mom!</p><p>Now she treats herself the way other men treat her. Like an object. A piece of meat.</p><p>That does it. Kid, get her out of here.</p><p>She’s killing it for the rest of us.</p><p>We’re not here, leave a message.</p><p>It’s Mrs. Huber, Susan, are you there?</p><p>I can see your lights are on.</p><p>I hope you’re not screening. That’s so tacky.</p><p>Listen. I need to talk to you.</p><p>My water heater just burst and it’s gonna cost me $ 600 to get a new one.</p><p>And I can’t afford that.</p><p>I’m just beside myself. Call me as soon as you get in.</p><p>Julie, honey, wake up.</p><p>We need to talk.</p><p>Can’t this wait until morning?</p><p>I think I’m being blackmailed.</p><p>And when I realized I couldn’t put out the fire, I ran.</p><p>I must’ve dropped the measuring cup in the process.</p><p>Why do I even let you out of the house?</p><p>Obviously, I can’t let her get away with this.</p><p>The only thing to do is go to the police and tell them what happened.</p><p>You can’t do that.</p><p>Julie, I don’t think they’ll throw me in jail.</p><p>I mean, it was an accident.</p><p>Dad won’t care if it was an accident.</p><p>You know he’ll just use this as an excuse to reopen custody.</p><p>- Mom, I don’t want to live with dad. - I know.</p><p>- I need to talk to you. - Cool. Sure.</p><p>- You were working tuesday, right? - Yeah.</p><p>You remember the cable guy showing up?</p><p>And you usually work till what time, five?</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>Damn it. That means he was in the house for four hours.</p><p>Wait. Now that I think about it, I might not have seen him.</p><p>Either you saw him or you didn’t. Which is it?</p><p>I didn’t.</p><p>John...</p><p>...did my wife ask you to lie for her?</p><p>Mr. Solis, uh... I really don’t want to get in the middle of anything.</p><p>Thank you. That’s all I needed to know.</p><p>Let’s run through it one more time.</p><p>Mom, it’s not brain surgery.</p><p>You’ll stand guard while I crawl through Mrs. Huber’s doggie door.</p><p>Once inside, I find the measuring cup.</p><p>Simple.</p><p>Mm, god. I hate that I’m turning you into a little thief.</p><p>It’s our cup. We’re just taking back what’s ours.</p><p>That’s right. Ethically, we have nothing to be ashamed about.</p><p>Oh. Wear these. I don’t want you to leave finger prints.</p><p>There she goes. Ok. Move.</p><p>Oh, so glad to be playing frisbee again.</p><p>Here you go. Coming at you All right. Back up a little more. There you go.</p><p>Whoo! All right. Here we go.</p><p>Oh, my, whoops! You better go get that. Yeah. Hah!</p><p>- Mike. - Hey, Susan.</p><p>I thought that was you.</p><p>Uh... Yeah. Julie and I are out tossing a frisbee around, and it flew off into Mrs. Huber’s back yard.</p><p>Oh, you need some help?</p><p>No, no, no. Julie’s got it.</p><p>Ok. I’m glad I ran into you.</p><p>I wanted to make sure things were ok between us.</p><p>The other day, you seemed kind of distant.</p><p>Distant? What do you mean?</p><p>I mean, you’re not mad at me for some reason, are you?</p><p>No. No, not at all.</p><p>Good. ’cause I’m gonna take one more shot.</p><p>I got tickets for a Billy Wilder retrospective, Wednesday night.</p><p>I’d love to take you with me.</p><p>You are so sweet. I’d love to go.</p><p>All right.</p><p>Eddie, I thought you’d be at work.</p><p>I’m not feeling well.</p><p>I got a sunburn the other day washing my car.</p><p>Well, don’t just run off. Come and hang out with us.</p><p>- Boy, you are one sick ticket. - What?</p><p>It’s not bad enough I have to watch you throw yourself at him every day.</p><p>Now you want to make sure I see it up close and personal?</p><p>- No, it’s not like that. - I’ve got to take off.</p><p>I’ll call about Wednesday night, ok?</p><p>Edie, wait.</p><p>Mike and I were gonna go see the movies on Wednesday and I thought it would be fun if you joined us.</p><p>- You want me to come with you? - Yeah.</p><p>Yeah, that’s ok, isn’t it, Mike?</p><p>Well, it’s a limited engagement.</p><p>And it’s sold out. I’ve only got two tickets.</p><p>Edie, wait. You should take my ticket.</p><p>Really? Is that ok with you, Mike?</p><p>Uh, yeah, sure.</p><p>So, uh, what time do you want to pick me up?</p><p>Hang on.</p><p>You think you can have sex with anyone you want, huh?</p><p>Carlos couldn’t help but feel proud of himself.</p><p>After all, he’d just defended his honor.</p><p>Or had he?</p><p>- Are you gay? - Yes. Is that why you’re doing this?</p><p>”Will you buy some chocolates?” Ladies.</p><p>Hey, Paul, what’s up?</p><p>I wanted to apologize for my outburst yesterday.</p><p>Don’t worry about it. We unloaded a lot on you.</p><p>I suppose you’re wondering why I reacted so violently to that note.</p><p>It did... cross our minds.</p><p>Well, the truth is, Mary Alice was not a well person.</p><p>She was very troubled.</p><p>- Troubled? - At first it was harmless.</p><p>She’d leave herself notes, reminders like, ”pick up the milk” or ”Zach has a dentist appointment.” But over time the notes became ugly.</p><p>Hateful messages started showing up.</p><p>Mary Alice was writing them to me, to Zach, to herself.</p><p>- Really? - That’s why I lost it.</p><p>I was reminded of what Zach and I had been through.</p><p>- Paul, I’m so sorry. - We had no idea.</p><p>No.</p><p>Anyway, I’d appreciate it if you kept this to yourselves.</p><p>- For Zach’s sake. - Of course. Of course.</p><p>Bye.</p><p>- I think he’s lying. - Huh. So do I.</p><p>You didn’t get me! Bang! Bang!</p><p>Boys, could you get in here, please?</p><p>- He broke my plane. - I did not.</p><p>We’ll talk about that later. I need you to take medicine.</p><p>Are we sick?</p><p>Not exactly. There is a special medicine.</p><p>It’s like a vitamin and you’ll take it every day, ok?</p><p>Stay right there.</p><p>Now open up.</p><p>- Here, you... - No.</p><p>- Guys, this is a... guys, here... - Nope.</p><p>In that moment, Lynette made a decision.</p><p>When it came to dealing with her children, medication was no longer an option.</p><p>Of course, given her continuing level of frustration, Lynette also felt a little self-medication couldn’t hurt.</p><p>So what’s your strategy?</p><p>Are you just never gonna speak to me again?</p><p>Something like that.</p><p>I suppose I do owe you an apology.</p><p>Careful. I wouldn’t want you to strain yourself.</p><p>I shouldn’t have lied to you about your father.</p><p>You two are old enough to handle the truth and I’m sorry.</p><p>Keep going.</p><p>I’m mad at you for about 7,000 other things.</p><p>If you think I’ll apologize for taking you out of a strip club, you’re wrong.</p><p>I consider it one of my finest moments.</p><p>Oh, Andrew.</p><p>I know you blame me for what’s happening with your father, but it’s not entirely my fault and I need you to understand that.</p><p>I do.</p><p>I just... don’t want him to leave.</p><p>Neither do I.</p><p>- Mom. - Yeah?</p><p>When can I have my door back?</p><p>Three months.</p><p>Royal Oaks was the scene of a hate crime today.</p><p>Jonathan Lisco, local gay activist and part-time female impersonator, was brutally attacked in his home.</p><p>Lisco speculated the attack was in response to his efforts to secure same-sex partner insurance coverage from his employer, Cliffside cable.</p><p>Police are circulating this sketch of the assailant.</p><p>The circumstances speak for themselves.</p><p>I’ve taken a strong stance with my company.</p><p>Is there something you want to ask me?</p><p>No.</p><p>You took it, didn’t you?</p><p>Good evening, Mrs. Huber.</p><p>It’s my own fault for not hiding the cup.</p><p>If you’re capable of arson, obviously you’re capable of breaking and entering.</p><p>I don’t know what you’re talking about. Mrs. Huber.</p><p>I suppose you destroyed it.</p><p>Again, I don’t know what you’re talking about, but... yeah, I did.</p><p>I was going to keep your secret.</p><p>It’s a shame you couldn’t trust me.</p><p>You’re a piece of work. Do you know that?</p><p>Oh, Susan, let’s not be unpleasant.</p><p>We can go back to the same friendly relationship we’ve always had.</p><p>I will keep my lawn looking nice.</p><p>And I would make sure my music isn’t played too loud.</p><p>And if I get some of your mail, heck, I’ll run it right over, ’cause that’s what good neighbors do.</p><p>But from now on, when I run into you on the street, and I say, ”good morning, Mrs. Huber” or ”how are you, Mrs. Huber?” Just know that inside I am quietly but decidedly hating your guts.</p><p>Careful, dear, let’s not say things we’ll live to regret.</p><p>Good evening, Mrs. Huber.</p><p>He actually said Mary Alice was crazy?</p><p>Not in so many words, but everything Paul said made it seem like she was schizophrenic.</p><p>I think he’s hiding something.
