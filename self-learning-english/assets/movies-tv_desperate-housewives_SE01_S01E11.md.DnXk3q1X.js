Smell you.</p><p>...was getting in over their heads.</p><p>Edie Britt could never understand why she didn’t have any female friends.</p><p>Of course, she always tried to tell people she didn’t ned any.</p><p>But the truth was it bothered Edie that other women didn’t seem to like her.</p><p>Even after moving to Wisteria Lane...</p><p>Be careful. There are breakables in there.</p><p>...Edie couldn’t understand why her neighbors kept their distance.</p><p>And then she met Martha Huber.</p><p>Hola!</p><p>Within five minutes Mrs. Huber managed to disparage what Edie was wearing.</p><p>No.</p><p>In fact, whenever they got together, Mrs. Huber insulted her.</p><p>She made fun of everything from Edie’s make-up...</p><p>...to her taste in men.</p><p>Yes, Martha Huber could be cruel, offensive and downright mean.</p><p>But Edie didn’t care, because she was the first real friend Edie Britt had ever had.</p><p>But now Martha Huber was missing.</p><p>She had vanished without a trace.</p><p>And Edie was not embarrassed to admit she needed her back.</p><p>- Edie? - Yes.</p><p>I’m Felicia Tillman.</p><p>- Martha’s sister. - Really?</p><p>- What’s wrong? - Nothing’s wrong.</p><p>It’s just Martha always said how alike you two were.</p><p>I just don’t see the family resemblance.</p><p>It’s there. It just takes a while to become apparent.</p><p>- Do you have the key to her house? - I do.</p><p>After the police kicked the door in, they put on this temporary lock.</p><p>Oh, and by the way, the neighbors are coming over at noon.</p><p>We’re going to organize and hand out flyers.</p><p>- The key? - Oh, right.</p><p>I can only imagine how worried you must be.</p><p>I’m not worried, Edie.</p><p>Martha and I have a very intense bond.</p><p>We were connected at a primal level.</p><p>A few days ago I felt this sensation in my soul.</p><p>It dawned on me that something had happened to my sister.</p><p>Then when she didn’t arrive at my home as scheduled, well, that’s when I knew she was dead.</p><p>Oh, honey, no. You mustn’t think like that.</p><p>Martha’s only missing.</p><p>No, Edie. She’s dead.</p><p>But she’s my sister and I’m going to find out exactly what happened to her.</p><p>Look, Felicia, it’s natural to freak out when a loved one’s missing.</p><p>Loved one?</p><p>Oh, Edie, let me be clear about this.</p><p>I hated Martha. She was a wretched pig of a woman.</p><p>The day she died, this world became a better place.</p><p>It was in that moment that Edie finally saw the family resemblance.</p><p>Mrs. Huber was missing.</p><p>The words echoed down Wisteria Lane until every last resident was aware of her disappearance.</p><p>By noon, dozens of neighbors had gathered.</p><p>Some came to volunteer. Some came in sympathy.</p><p>And some came to learn exactly what the police knew...</p><p>and what they didn’t.</p><p>I’ll need you to pass out flyers.</p><p>Put ’em in the mall, the park.</p><p>Anywhere you think Mrs. Huber might have been seen.</p><p>We need to jump on this. Time is of the essence.</p><p>Edie, would you like to say something?</p><p>On behalf of Martha and her sister, Felicia...</p><p>I’d like to thank you all for coming here today.</p><p>You know, my last conversation with Martha was one of anger, And I’ll never forgive myself for the things that I said.</p><p>I lay awake at night thinking about it.</p><p>I don’t know how she did it, but Edie managed to make this all about her.</p><p>She’s a talented girl, our Edie.</p><p>Has anybody talked to Bree?</p><p>- How’s Rex doing? - She’s bringing him home today.</p><p>I don’t know how he had a heart attack. He was so young.</p><p>- How creepy is Mrs. Huber’s sister? - I know.</p><p>She was talking about Mrs. Huber like she was already dead.</p><p>You don’t think she’s...?</p><p>No, I’m sure she’s fine.</p><p>We are talking about Mrs. Huber. She’s like a roach.</p><p>I just want you to know, everyone on Wisteria Lane is praying for your sister’s safe return.</p><p>I seriously doubt that.</p><p>What do you mean you’re not taking care of him?</p><p>Dad’s being released today.</p><p>He’s gotta have a place to recuperate.</p><p>He can go to a motel. He’s not allowed back in my house.</p><p>You two were getting along. What happened?</p><p>That’s... between your father and me.</p><p>You’re selfish.</p><p>I am so looking forward to the day that I get to put you in a nursing home.</p><p>I’m sorry to disappoint you, Andew but my plan is to have an embolism and to die young.</p><p>We’re all rooting for you, but you might not be so lucky.</p><p>Andrew...</p><p>You wanna say how long I can hold a grudge?</p><p>Go ahead and abandon my father, because I promise you, you’ll be sorry.</p><p>You wouldn’t be saying that if you knew what...</p><p>Knew what? Come on, tell me.</p><p>because I’d love to know what my father did that was so awful.</p><p>Fine. I will see him through this, but after that, your father can rot in hell for all I care.</p><p>We’re not like other families, are we?</p><p>No, we’re not.</p><p>Gabrielle, it’s not my fault that your bank accounts are frozen.</p><p>I’m not saying it’s your fault. I’m just saying fix it.</p><p>Well, I wish I could, but the folks at the justice department aren’t very sympathetic.</p><p>I’m running out of money.</p><p>In a couple of weeks, I’m going to be screwed.</p><p>Why don’t you hock some jewelry?</p><p>There’s a lot of stuff you never wear and most of it’s ugly.</p><p>Don’t you have a toilet to scrub?</p><p>God, I’m just so angry with Carlos.</p><p>What was he thinking, exporting goods made from slave labor?</p><p>Why couldn’t he have embezzled like other white-collar criminals?</p><p>All the justice department wants is to make sure that Carlos doesn’t skip the country.</p><p>If he’s released on bail, I can argue that he needs money to live on, and they’ll probably unfreeze one of the smaller accounts.</p><p>They won’t release him without the passport.</p><p>Exactly. You haven’t found that yet, have you?</p><p>Gabrielle wanted her old lifestyle back, no question.</p><p>But she wanted Carlos to suffer for his betrayal even more.</p><p>I’m still searching.</p><p>In that case, you might wanna think about looking for a job.</p><p>- I had a really good time. - I bet you did.</p><p>Gotcha!</p><p>Hey. Is this a bad time?</p><p>For you? Of course it is.</p><p>Cute. Tax stuff. I need your signature.</p><p>- We’ve been divorced over a year. - 2003.</p><p>Well, please, just come on in.</p><p>Mike, I don’t think you’ve officially met my ex, Karl Mayer.</p><p>Hey. Mike Delfino.</p><p>Right. The plumber.</p><p>I don’t have the right washer for this faucet.</p><p>So I’m just gonna go on across the street and get it.</p><p>- So he seems ok. - Yeah, he is.</p><p>So, what do you want me to sign? Oh, I see.</p><p>By the way, Julie told me about her birthday plans.</p><p>We’re going to a restaurant downtown.</p><p>A guy who plays piano and open mic.</p><p>Julie got a bunch of her girlfriends together and so we’re just going to make a night of it.</p><p>- Julie loves to sing. It sounds nice. - Here you go.</p><p>- All righty. - Give my best to Brandi.</p><p>Actually, um... we’re not together any more.</p><p>You’re not? What happened?</p><p>I... caught her in bed with another guy.</p><p>Go ahead. Do your happy dance.</p><p>No, no, really. I’m sorry that you had to go through that. I am.</p><p>It’s just really hard for me right now.</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>Um, try ripping up old photos. It helps.</p><p>Well, have fun this weekend.</p><p>Let me know how the party goes.</p><p>Karl, do you want to join us?</p><p>Susan...</p><p>You’re the best.</p><p>Oh, well... Yeah. I’m the best, aren’t I?</p><p>You know, if we gonna buy a water heater, we should talk about it.</p><p>We could go to the mall tomorrow and they have a sale Can we talk about this tomorrow?</p><p>Well, I’m just trying to plan my day.</p><p>Please, honey. I’m so tired.</p><p>Ok.</p><p>Hon, did you set up the coffee maker?</p><p>Oh, no. I’ll do it in the morning.</p><p>I promise I’ll get up early and do it.</p><p>Tom Tom Come on.</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>Claire?!</p><p>I’m, uh... Wow, I’m sorry. I didn’t know you were up.</p><p>Yeah, I thought you were sleeping.</p><p>I was just going upstairs.</p><p>Do you want me to make the coffee?</p><p>Yeah. Yeah, that’d be great.</p><p>I’m just going to, you know, go back up to my room.</p><p>- Ok. - All right.</p><p>- Night. - Good night.</p><p>Also you know,if we go to the mall, we can go to the shoe store.</p><p>You said you wanted new running shoes.</p><p>What?</p><p>The next morning, while the search for Martha Huber continued, Lynette discovered a little family secret, one she wasn’t even looking for.</p><p>- Good morning. - Morning.</p><p>- Want some coffee? - Yeah, thanks.</p><p>I didn’t want to come down till Tom left for work.</p><p>- I’m still a little embarrassed. - About what?</p><p>He didn’t tell you?</p><p>Well, actually it’s kinda funny.</p><p>I was doing some laundry, and I noticed the robe I was wearing had some baby food on it, so I threw it in, figuring I could dash upstairs while everyone was asleep, and then I ran into Tom... while I was totally naked.</p><p>And so, Claire, when did this... incident occur?</p><p>I don’t know. It was pretty late.</p><p>I think he might have come down to make coffee or something.</p><p>You don’t say.</p><p>This is certainly impressive.</p><p>I can definitely get you work as a model.</p><p>But you do realize it’s different from the runnway work you did in New york and Milan?</p><p>Of course. I made $ 10,000 a day.</p><p>I don’t expect to make that here.</p><p>That’s good, because you won’t.</p><p>Yeah. So, what have you got?</p><p>Well, there is something.</p><p>They need a model to demonstrate the new Buick Lacrosse at the Fairview mall.</p><p>It’s just gonna be you and the car on a revolving platform.</p><p>300 bucks for the day.</p><p>- Uh, what else do you have? - Sure.</p><p>Um... Ooh. Can you swing a sword?</p><p>Sci-fi convention needs someone to dress up as a warrior princess.</p><p>A warrior princess?</p><p>Mr. Gibb, I am a professional model.</p><p>Look at this bone structure. This face is a cash cow.</p><p>And if you don’t have the vision to take advantage of that, then maybe I’m at the wrong agency.</p><p>Look, honey, I’m the only modeling agent in a hundred-mile radius.</p><p>I book women for boat shows and garden-tool expos.</p><p>If you don’t like it, move back to the city.</p><p>This, um, Buick thing, does it include lunch?</p><p>Just so you know, I really am grateful for everything you’re doing for me.</p><p>I don’t need your gratitude.</p><p>You’re only here because your children are master extortionists.</p><p>- So you didn’t tell ’em about... - Your adultery?</p><p>No, I decided to keep that little gem all to myself.</p><p>Listen, I know this is a real imposition...</p><p>Yes, it is. The doctor said you could be here for weeks.</p><p>Would it make you feel any better if I told you I’m sorry for what I did?</p><p>Yes, it would... if I still felt anything for you.</p><p>But as it stands, the place you used to occupy in my heart is very much empty now.</p><p>You must still feel something for me.</p><p>And why do you think that?</p><p>Come on, Bree. Look at this.</p><p>You are using the good china, freshly pressed napkins, flowers from the garden.</p><p>This tray was prepared with loving care.</p><p>Do me a favor,Rex.</p><p>Please don’t mistake my anal retentiveness for actual affection.</p><p>Hold on a sec.</p><p>Ok. Now I’m good.</p><p>- What? - You’re just... God, I love you.</p><p>That’s great.</p><p>Wait, look. That just kinda popped out.</p><p>No, no, it’s fine. It just kinda caught me off guard.</p><p>I mean, I wanna say it back...</p><p>Yeah, but you’re not ready. It’s ok.</p><p>- You’re not mad, are you? - No. God.</p><p>We haven’t been dating that long and you’ve got other issues.</p><p>- I get it. - Good.</p><p>Issues, what kind of issues do you think I have?</p><p>You know,I retract my earlier statement. I no longer love you.</p><p>- In fact,I just think of you as a good buddy. - No.</p><p>You obviously think you have some insight into my soul, so please go ahead, dazzle me.</p><p>Your divorce left you vulnerable.</p><p>Big insight. The postman knows that.</p><p>And there’s a chance you still have feelings for your ex.</p><p>What?</p><p>I loathe Karl.</p><p>And the postman will back me up on that, too.</p><p>I’m sure part of you does hate him, but maybe part of you is still hung up on him.</p><p>Where are you getting this?</p><p>He broke up with the woman he left you for.</p><p>And what was the first thing you did you hugged him and invited him to a party.</p><p>The analysis part of this evening is now over.</p><p>- Hey... You asked. - Well, you know what?</p><p>You’re gonna come to Julie’s party and you’re gonna see Karl and I together, and you’re gonna understand once for all that I have no feelings for him.</p><p>Actually I have tickets to a basketball game.</p><p>Actually you’re coming to the party tomorrow.</p><p>This is what I get for saying ”I love you”.</p><p>- What? - Nothing.</p><p>- Thanks. - Hello, George.</p><p>Mrs. Van de Kamp. You’re looking lovely today.</p><p>You always say the nicest things.</p><p>Well, it’s, uh... it’s true.</p><p>Oh. Listen, I have a prescription here for Rex.</p><p>I don’t know if you heard but he had a heart attack.</p><p>- I had no idea. Is he ok? - Yes, he’ll live.</p><p>But the doctor says he’s at risk for something called pericarditis.</p><p>It’s an inflammation of the membrane that surrounds the heart.</p><p>Take few months to make sure that it doesn’t develop - and he’ll need constant care. - So I hear.</p><p>As the words ”constant care” echoed in her head, Bree caught a sickening glimpse into her future...</p><p>Ok, here we go.</p><p>...Which prompted her to seek an old-fashioned remedy.</p><p>George, would you go out to dinner with me?</p><p>Um, you mean like a date?</p><p>Yes. I think it would be fun.</p><p>What about your husband?</p><p>Oh, him.</p><p>Well, we’re... separated.</p><p>In spite of Mrs. Huber’s disappearance, life on Wisteria Lane started to return to normal, until an intriguing discovery was made on a dirt road next to the interstate.</p><p>This is Officer Burdon. I have an abandoned vehicle registered to a missing person, one Martha Huber.</p><p>Please advise.</p><p>As news spread of this mysterious development, everyone in the neighborhood decided to band together to show their support, and to look for clues, or worse.</p><p>I’m keeping my eyes on the horizon.</p><p>Tell me if I am about to step on a body part.</p><p>It’s a search and rescue, not recover.</p><p>We don’t know if she’s dead.</p><p>People fake their own abductions all the time.</p><p>Can we talk about something else, something less depressing?</p><p>Well, here’s something. Mike told me he loved me.</p><p>- Oh, my god! - Over here! They found the body!</p><p>NO! I’m sorry, false alarm. We didn’t find a body.</p><p>Ah, Susan just had some really good news.</p><p>- Sorry. - False alarm.</p><p>Well, doesn’t that figure?</p><p>Susan always finds a way to make it about her.</p><p>Ladies and gentleman, I present to you the fabulous Buick Lacrosse.</p><p>It has an expertly crafted interior, peaceful quiet tuning and ultrasonic rear parking assist.</p><p>Observe the remote activation feature.</p><p>And it also has a lot of other exciting, good, cool car things.</p><p>Tom! Lynette! What are you doing here?</p><p>Buying a new water heater. How about you?</p><p>Just doing a little shopping. Trying to get my mind off things.</p><p>Gaby, you need help? It looks like you’re stuck here.</p><p>- I guess I am. - No worry, I got it.</p><p>Guess I got too close to the turntable.</p><p>- I’m a sucker for these Buicks. - Come on, you bastard!</p><p>With their perfectly crafted interior and peaceful quiet tuning.</p><p>Uh-huh. A little formal for the mall.</p><p>Oh! You know, I... I wanted to match the shoes to the dress.</p><p>This is Sarah, my shopping buddy.</p><p>We like to hit the boutiques together.</p><p>Ok. Well, you gals, um, shop your little hearts out. See you later.</p><p>Bye!</p><p>Wow. Look at you. You going out?</p><p>Not that it’s any of your business, but, um, I have a date.</p><p>A date? What kind of date?</p><p>Rex, I don’t want to say anything that might upset you.</p><p>The doctor says any undue stress could cause another heart attack.</p><p>It’s a romantic date with a single attractive man.</p><p>I intend to French the hell out of him.</p><p>Oh. Right on time.</p><p>In my spare time I garden. I thought you might like these.</p><p>Oh, they’re exquisite. Compost and eggs shells?</p><p>- Yes. - Oh. Come on in.</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>George, you remember Rex.</p><p>- I thought you said you were separated. - We are, emotionally.</p><p>Physically he lives here because his mistress refuses to care for him.</p><p>- Would you like a drink? - No, I’m fine. Thanks.</p><p>Rex, say hello to George.</p><p>Hello, George.</p><p>Hello, Dr. Van de Kamp.</p><p>I’m gonna put these in water. George, have a seat and I’ll be right back.</p><p>So, how’s your heart, Dr. Van de Kamp?</p><p>- Better. How’s the pharmacy? - Busy. It’s busy.</p><p>- Is something funny? - It’s... It’s nothing.</p><p>See, I recently engaged in some extra-curricular activity, and now Bree’s doing anything she can to make me suffer.</p><p>- All you can do is laugh. - Yeah, I... I guess.</p><p>These flowers are stunning.</p><p>They’re the best ones I’ve ever gotten.</p><p>Shall we?</p><p>Nice talking to you, Dr. Van de Kamp.</p><p>Please, you’re dating my wife.</p><p>Call me rex.</p><p>That salesgirl that sold us the heater had a cute figure.</p><p>I guess. I didn’t notice.</p><p>How can you say. She was so your type.</p><p>- Big breasts. Really curvy. - What are you doing?</p><p>I’m saying you prefer women who are really curvy, like that salesgirl...</p><p>or Claire.</p><p>There was only one type did I prefer. You.</p><p>You kissed me as though that would end this conversation, and it so won’t.</p><p>Why am I in trouble? Haven’t I done anything wrong.</p><p>You made love to me the other night because you had just seen Claire naked.</p><p>Wha...?</p><p>Aw, crap.</p><p>Claire is a great nanny.</p><p>It would be stupid to lose her over something like this.</p><p>You and I have had crushes before.</p><p>We always tell each other, we laugh about it.</p><p>It’s no big deal.</p><p>What worries me about this is you’re denying you’re obviously attracted. Why?</p><p>- I’m not denying anything. - So you are attracted to her?</p><p>I didn’t say that. What are you doing?</p><p>We are not going anywhere until you confess you have the hots for our nanny.</p><p>Tom, it’s ok. She’s attractive.</p><p>Men by nature are drawn to fertile, young women with whom they can plant their seed.</p><p>It’s the basic flaw of your gender.</p><p>I get it. Just do me the honor...</p><p>We’d all like to get out of here. Is there a problem?</p><p>My husband won’t admit that he has lust in his heart.</p><p>Can you give us a minute?</p><p>Lynette, Claire is attractive, yes.</p><p>But I am not attracted to her.</p><p>If I thought for even a second that there was any danger in having Claire around, I’d be the first to get rid of her.</p><p>It’s you. You’re the one.</p><p>You always have been and you always will be.</p><p>All right! Hold your water!</p><p><em>we drink ice cream soda here</em> <em>down at the old five and dime!</em> - Yay. You guys were fantastic. - Thank you.</p><p>They’ve got a dance floor upstairs, we’re gonna go and check it out.</p><p>Ok. Have fun.</p><p>- Edie, over here! - What the hell is she doing here?</p><p>I don’t get to bring a date? I heard you were bringing him.</p><p>Of all people, you pick that tired piece of... Edie!</p><p>Hi, Susan. Thank you so much for the invite.</p><p>God knows I needed something to get my mind off poor Martha.</p><p>A kiss for the birthday boy.</p><p>Um, Edie, it’s not his birthday.</p><p>Thank you, George. That was a lovely evening.</p><p>The pleasure was mine.</p><p>There’s nothing better than great conversation with a beautiful woman over a delicious meal.</p><p>Well, I guess I should go inside.</p><p>- I’m glad we did this. - Me too.</p><p>Andrew. Where did you come from?</p><p>I was just on my way back from Brian’s house.</p><p>What’s going on here?</p><p>You remember Mr. Williams, our pharmacist?</p><p>- Hey there. - How’s it going?</p><p>What are you doing in his car?</p><p>We’re just, um... talking.</p><p>Mr. Williams took me out to dinner.</p><p>You mean like on a date?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>You are aware that she’s married, right?</p><p>Your father and I are separated, you know it.</p><p>I don’t care. Couldn’t you wait until he was out of the house?</p><p>The only reason he’s still in the house is because you insisted I care for him.</p><p>So what are you guys gonna do now?</p><p>Are you two gonna have sex?</p><p>- No, we are not going to have sex! - Why not?</p><p>Because I don’t commit adultery like your father!</p><p>That’s right, your father had an affair. I found out about it.</p><p>I’m just trying to move on with my life.</p><p>You should watch out for her. She’s a liar.</p><p>Andrew...</p><p>In spite of her mounting debt, Gabrielle was determined to prove she could get along just fine without Carlos’s money.</p><p>It wasn’t until the electricity went out that she finally began to see the light.</p><p>Mr. Hartley, it’s Gabrielle Solis.</p><p>I need you to start working on releasing Carlos on bail. Mm-hm.</p><p>I just remembered where I put his passport.</p><p><em>but I, I took the sweet life</em> <em>and never knew I’d be bitter from the sweet</em> <em>I spent my life exploring the subtle whoring</em> <em>that costs too much to be free</em> <em>hey, lady</em> <em>I’ve ben to paradise</em> <em>but I’ve never been</em> <em>to me</em> Oh, thank you!</p><p>Damn, woman. You are good.</p><p>Yes! All right, you’re next, Susie-q.</p><p>What you gonna sing?</p><p>- You sing? - Only when I’m alone.</p><p>- Come on, we’re among friends. - I don’t think so.</p><p>I for one would love to hear your voice.</p><p>Give it up, plumber. She’s not budging.</p><p>- You wanna hear me sing? - Yeah.</p><p>Ok.</p><p>What’s it gonna be? I’ll tell the piano player.</p><p>- New York, New York. - I am so excited to hear you.</p><p>- Oh, but doesn’t it just figure? - What do you mean?</p><p>You have to get up in front of a room full of people dressed like that.</p><p>I hope they don’t turn on you.</p><p>I think I’ll take my chances.</p><p>Sort of like you did on those high notes.</p><p>- I’m gonna get us two more. - That’s a great idea.</p><p>So that Mike, seems pretty even-keeled.</p><p>Yeah. He’s a great guy.</p><p>But, you know, I mean, he’s a little buster brown.</p><p>Don’t you worry you’ll get bored?</p><p>Thanks for your concern. Karl. I’m fine.</p><p>Go figure. Even though our marriage was crazy at times, it never got dull.</p><p>Yeah. That part when you slept with your secretary was really exciting.</p><p>I know. How many times do I have to hear it? I, I...</p><p>It was a mistake.</p><p>But don’t I ever get credit for the 13 loyal years beforehand?</p><p>Let’s not be counting the Hendersons’ Christmas party.</p><p>Edie, not now.</p><p>What’s the big deal, Karl?</p><p>- Your marriage is history, anyway. - Edie...</p><p>It was nothing, really.</p><p>Basically, we both got plastered on eggnog and we found ourselves standing under the mistletoe, and we were like, ”Ok, so what do we do now?” So I smiled and he smiled and then Karl reached over and started feeling me up.</p><p>- Susie, that’s not how it happened. - Come on. You’re up.</p><p>This is... it’s so silly.

Look at me!</p><p>You know what are we doing during our marriage.</p><p>How many other women were you sticking it to?</p><p>As god is my witness, it will snow on the hills of hell before I ever feel sorry for you again!</p><p><em>New York!</em> As the police interviewed the residents of Wisteria Lane about the mysterious disappearance of Martha Huber, my husband Paul reasoned it would only be a matter of time before their digging would begin to yield answers.</p><p>Since he knew the police had no suspects...</p><p>...He decided to point them towards the most logical candidate.</p><p>You see, if there’s one thing Paul understood about the suburbs.</p><p>It was this.</p><p>No one’s ever more suspicious than a new neighbor who’s just moved in.</p><p>Parker’s getting sniffly.</p><p>Yeah, I noticed that too.</p><p>I hope he’s not coming down with a cold.</p><p>He doesn’t have a cough yet, but he has this post nasal drip thing happening.</p><p>I’ll make an appointment for him.</p><p>I always say it is better to be safe than sorry.</p><p>Little kids get sick, and it’s, sorry, out of control.</p><p>And kids with these colds, it’s just a vicious cycle.</p><p>Um, Claire?</p><p>We have to make some changes.</p><p>What are you doing?</p><p>I’m packing up your father’s things for when he eventually moves out.</p><p>Here, let me help you.</p><p>Look, I talked to dad, and it turns out you were telling the truth.</p><p>Andrew, I’m so sorry that I said anything.</p><p>No, I’m glad you did. Now I know.</p><p>There comes this point in every boy’s life.</p><p>What? Find out his dad’s screwing around?</p><p>No. That his father’s only human.</p><p>So why are you taking care of him?</p><p>Because of what Danielle and I said?</p><p>Because you can forget that.</p><p>I’ll help take his stuff out on the street if you want.</p><p>That’s sweet.</p><p>But I’m taking care of him because it’s the right thing to do.</p><p>Why are you being such a pushover?</p><p>I mean, he cheated on you. He’s a jerk.</p><p>Andrew, you will not speak that way about your father in front of me.</p><p>Why the hell not?</p><p>I mean, for once I’m actually on your side.</p><p>Yes, I’m angry with him. I am gonna divorce him.</p><p>I may even marry somebody else, but make no mistake about it.</p><p>Your father is and always will be the love of my life.</p><p>He gave me the best 18-year marriage that...</p><p>...I could have ever hoped for.</p><p>And for that you will respect him.</p><p>Ok.</p><p>What is it? I’m really, really busy.</p><p>I came by to apologize.</p><p>In that case, come on in. I’m not doing anything.</p><p>I can’t believe Edie brought the whole thing up.</p><p>Susan, I am so sorry. I...</p><p>I thought I was done hurting you.</p><p>Yeah, me too.</p><p>And just so you know, I’m... Sorry for flipping out.</p><p>I shouldn’t let you get to me like that.</p><p>- What? - I do still get to you, don’t I?</p><p>That’s the difference between the plumber and me.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, he’s a good guy.</p><p>I like him.</p><p>But I’m betting you two don’t have what we had together.</p><p>There was always a spark between us.</p><p>A spark?</p><p>Look, what I’m trying to say is he must seem really safe after me.</p><p>A moray eel would seem safe after you.</p><p>That’s what I’m talking about.</p><p>The great back and forth, joking around.</p><p>We used to argue and push each other’s buttons.</p><p>News flash. I hated all of that.</p><p>Come on. You have to admit, when it was good, it was the best.</p><p>What are you saying?</p><p>Let’s give this another shot.</p><p>- You want me back? - Yeah.</p><p>Yeah. I realize now you were the woman...</p><p>...that was meant for me.</p><p>Just so we’re clear, so you want to move back in here.</p><p>And be faithful to me and love me with all your heart and soul?</p><p>- Absolutely. - Oh, my god, this is so wonderful.</p><p>Yeah. I know, I know.</p><p>- I wanna kiss you. - Oh, god. No, Karl.</p><p>No. What I meant by wonderful is that I wondered inside if I still had feelings for you, if deep down I still loved you.</p><p>- And? - And... there’s nothing there.</p><p>Come on, you’ve gotta feel something.</p><p>Well, actually, I do. Yeah.</p><p>Excuse me.</p><p>- Susan. - Mike, guess what? I love you.</p><p>- Are you sure? - Yes!</p><p>Did I come at a bad time?</p><p>They’re just asking about Mrs. Huber.</p><p>I love him. You can write that in your little book.</p><p>We are all searching for someone, that special person who will provide us what’s missing in our lives.</p><p>Someone who can offer companionship.</p><p>George? Hi, it’s me, Bree.</p><p>I was wondering, are you free next Saturday?</p><p>You are? Oh, that’s wonderful.</p><p>Or assistance.</p><p>Hi, I understand your agency handles nannies.</p><p>I need someone experienced and preferably unattractive.</p><p>Or security.</p><p>Hi, honey. Did the lawyer tell you the good news?</p><p>You’re gonna make bail. I found your passport.</p><p>And sometimes, if we search very hard, we can find someone who provides us...</p><p>I just called to say hi, and I love you.</p><p>...with all three.</p><p>All right, all right. Enough already.</p><p>Yes, we’re all searching for someone.</p><p>And if we can’t find them, we can only pray they find us.</p><p>What you got, boy?</p>',578),s=[n];function r(i,h,u,l,d,y){return o(),t("div",null,s)}const w=e(p,[["render",r]]);export{g as __pageData,w as default};
