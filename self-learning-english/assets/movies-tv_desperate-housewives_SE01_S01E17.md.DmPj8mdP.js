We have to talk.</p><p>This is crazy.</p><p>I know.</p><p>Everything the cop said is true. I did kill somebody.</p><p>But there’s one thing they didn’t tell you.</p><p>I killed for you, Susan.</p><p>Susan, if I can’t have you, no one else can.</p><p>Shut up.</p><p>Susan, are you home?</p><p>Susan? Your car’s here. I know you’re in there.</p><p>I was hoping we could talk for a minute.</p><p>Susan, maybe you should have waited till I left to do that.</p><p>I know you don’t want to see me right now but I owe you an explanation, and it’s all in there, everything you ever wanted to know about my past, my reasons for doing what I did.</p><p>It’s all there.</p><p>Guys, come on. What are you doing?</p><p>You know, just bonding, discussing current events...</p><p>Seriously, if you’d just parked across the street I could have let you go.</p><p>Why don’t you just pretend like we did?</p><p>Get out of the car.</p><p>Get this.</p><p>Stop the car! Hey! Hey!</p><p>I can’t believe it.</p><p>Two months from graduation and he’s expelled.</p><p>We are just lucky that security guard did not press charges.</p><p>So what are we going to do?</p><p>Well, I’m glad that you asked.</p><p>What are these?</p><p>Brochures for youth detention centers.</p><p>How long have you had these?</p><p>They’ve been in the drawer a few months.</p><p>I had a feeling we might need them.</p><p>Bree... I don’t know.</p><p>We have to admit that we need help.</p><p>If we can’t get through to Andrew, we need someone who can.</p><p>You really want to send our son away to some prison camp?</p><p>Don’t be so dramatic.</p><p>Some of these places actually look fun.</p><p>Look. Camp Hennessy.</p><p>”Teaches kids respect for authority and boundaries in a summer camp atmosphere.” The perimeter is surrounded by an electrified fence.</p><p>You have to admit that’s an efficient way to teach respect for boundaries.</p><p>Ok, how about this one?</p><p>It’s perfect for Andrew.</p><p>It’s a ranch in Montana.</p><p>It has lots of fresh air and plenty of open spaces, and daily classes on anger management.</p><p>I’m not comfortable with this.</p><p>All right, how about this one?</p><p>It’s in the desert and it’s very reasonable.</p><p>The barracks are a little bit bleak but that recidivism rate is to die for.</p><p>Bree, I’m not doing it.</p><p>I’m not sending my son away.</p><p>It’s easy for you, isn’t it?</p><p>You’re not the one he’s rude to, the one he challenges every day.</p><p>You’re not the one he hates.</p><p>I’ll talk to him. All right?</p><p>I’ll sit him down for a little old-fashioned heart-to-heart.</p><p>You talk to him all you want.</p><p>I’m gonna check out the place with the electrified fence.</p><p>Listen, my children, and you shall hear of the midnight ride of Paul Revere hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch of the north church tower one if by land, two if by sea and I on the opposite shore will be.</p><p>Hi, I wanted to introduce myself to your mom.</p><p>I’m Lynette Scavo.</p><p>Hi, Lynette. I’m Alisa Stevens.</p><p>Oh, I’m sorry! I thought...</p><p>I read lips.</p><p>A lot of the time, signing is just easier.</p><p>I don’t like to misunderstand, or to be misunderstood.</p><p>- And I’m Lily. - Hi, nice to meet you.</p><p>Hi, mom!</p><p>That’s my son, Matt.</p><p>My twins talk about Matt all the time.</p><p>We should set up a play date.</p><p>Sounds great.</p><p>- Let’s have dinner too. - I’d love to.</p><p>- The British are coming! - Giddy-up! Giddy-up!</p><p>Even better, let’s just keep it adults.</p><p>Babe, they blinked.</p><p>We got them by the short hairs.</p><p>Who? Who blinked?</p><p>The da. I just spoke with the lawyers.</p><p>- They offered a plea bargain. - And that’s good?</p><p>It means they know they got a weak case.</p><p>They don’t think they can win.</p><p>- It’s over. - Oh, my god!</p><p>That means we can keep the house!</p><p>No, we still have to sell the house.</p><p>I gotta pay the lawyers.</p><p>You said they offered a plea bargain.</p><p>Yeah, but we’re not gonna take that.</p><p>Put me down.</p><p>Honey, it would mean me going to jail for eight months.</p><p>I think that’s pretty reasonable, considering you’re guilty as sin.</p><p>You said you were fine with selling.</p><p>Before I knew we could trade a couple of months in prison to keep it.</p><p>What?!</p><p>No, this is her daughter-in-law.</p><p>Is it the hospital? Is it mama?</p><p>Uh, thank you. Yes.</p><p>Gabby?</p><p>I’m sorry, Carlos.</p><p>Some believe people are judged by the way they live life, and others by the way they leave it.</p><p>I like the lexington mahogany with gold leaf.</p><p>It has a pink velvet interior and drapes, plus it’s hand-engraved so in case of a flood or earthquake, they’ll at least know which one is hers.</p><p>Don’t you think that’s a little over the top?</p><p>Only the best for mama.</p><p>These funeral homes make a fortune trying to convince people to overspend.</p><p>What are you saying?</p><p>I’m saying your mother was a sensible woman.</p><p>She wouldn’t be comfortable with bells and whistles.</p><p>Maybe this one. Wood veneer.</p><p>- What? - You never liked mama.</p><p>It’s awfully hard to like someone who actively hates your guts.</p><p>She always thought you married beneath you and let me know it.</p><p>She loved you.</p><p>She treated me like trash!</p><p>God rest her soul.</p><p>I’m putting my mother in the grave.</p><p>Now is not the time to pinch pennies.</p><p>Carlos, we’re not exactly flush with cash right now.</p><p>Let her be true to her roots. She was born humble.</p><p>And barefoot.</p><p>She was a queen.</p><p>So what did Mike say when he gave you the letter?</p><p>That it explains everything.</p><p>Does it?</p><p>I haven’t read it.</p><p>Why the hell not?</p><p>I just can’t.</p><p>You’re a better woman than me.</p><p>I’d have ripped it open with my teeth.</p><p>Aren’t you dying to know what he wrote?</p><p>Yes. But what if it’s just a bunch of far-fetched stories?</p><p>Well, you should assume that it is.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Think how good men are at lying on the spot.</p><p>God forbid you should give them time and a pen.</p><p>Edie, you mind stopping by the site?</p><p>I’ve blueprints of the master bath.</p><p>Oh, I’ll see you in a few, Bill.</p><p>It’s my new contractor. We’re sort of dating.</p><p>Didn’t you once say you never mix business with pleasure?</p><p>No, I said never mix pleasure with commitment.</p><p>Right.</p><p>So Susan, what are you gonna do with the letter?</p><p>And for Pete’s sake, would you open it up already?</p><p>No. No, I won’t.</p><p>I don’t trust Mike any more and without trust...</p><p>No, no. I’m just gonna go in and rip it up and throw it in the trash.</p><p>- Why don’t we rip it up now? - No, no, no.</p><p>That’s ok. I don’t wanna... You know, litter.</p><p>She is so opening that letter.</p><p>While Carlos was making arrangements to bury his mother, Gabrielle was making sure she’d be taking her secret to the grave.</p><p>Hi, I’m Gabrielle Solis.</p><p>You’re nurse... Hisel?</p><p>Yes. Hi. Um... When you called and said you were coming down, I collected all the personal things your husband brought in during Juanita’s stay with us.</p><p>I assume that’s why you’re stopping by?</p><p>Oh, that’s so thoughtful of you but, actually, no.</p><p>No?</p><p>No, you see my husband and I still don’t have a clear account as to how Juanita passed.</p><p>How?</p><p>Yes, did she die quietly, in her sleep...?</p><p>Um, yeah, that’s usually how it happens.</p><p>I mean, I’m pretty sure that’s how it happened.</p><p>Pretty sure?</p><p>I mean, I don’t know exactly because I wasn’t with her at that time.</p><p>Was anyone with her?</p><p>An orderly, candy striper...</p><p>...anyone?</p><p>No. She was alone.</p><p>Thank you so much. That’s all I needed to hear.</p><p>Oh, Mrs. Solis.</p><p>Oh, you can just toss that.</p><p>Great! Just great.</p><p>I think this is yours.</p><p>Yeah. Yeah, I’ve been looking for this one. Thanks.</p><p>I don’t suppose you have any idea where I found it?</p><p>Those little suckers are drawn to bare feet and car tires.</p><p>Since you’re not limping or bleeding...</p><p>This is only temporary.</p><p>You’re going to need to take this tire and get it fixed.</p><p>- Thanks, I will. - Seriously, it’s not safe.</p><p>You’ll probably only get 20 or 30 miles out of it.</p><p>All right, I promise.</p><p>Hey, listen. I’m about to break for lunch.</p><p>- How would you like to join me? - Lunch?</p><p>Yeah, lunch.</p><p>Are you asking me out on a date?</p><p>That sounds kinda formal for a burrito and a can of soda, but...Yeah, I guess I am.</p><p>Aren’t you dating Edie?</p><p>We went out on a date. We’re not dating.</p><p>So how about it?</p><p>I’m buying.</p><p>I just got out of this relationship with this guy, Mike.</p><p>It’s kind of complicated.</p><p>Anyway, I’m just not even sure where I am right now, emotionally.</p><p>I’m all jumbled up.</p><p>I don’t think I can leap right into something new, relationship-wise, at the moment.</p><p>Again, just a burrito.</p><p>- I’m sorry. - Ok, I understand.</p><p>Sounds like you need time to reflect and heal.</p><p>- I do, I really do. - Ok.</p><p>I’ll check back with you again tomorrow.</p><p>This is so... delicious.</p><p>I don’t know how you find the time, with four kids.</p><p>Only for first-time guests.</p><p>Normally, you’d be having chicken fingers and cartoon-shaped macaroni.</p><p>- If that. - Hey, shut up.</p><p>Tom, you’re in advertising, right?</p><p>I worked five years at Simon and Scott.</p><p>Well, I started at Simon and Scott.</p><p>I hated those guys.</p><p>- We have to talk. - Yes...</p><p>Who do you know there now?</p><p>It’s all over now.</p><p>They’ll be talking shop for the rest of the night.</p><p>Alisa loves talking about Alisa.</p><p>Well, Lynette loves talking about Lynette too.</p><p>I don’t believe that for a second.</p><p>You and your husband seem pretty solid.</p><p>We’re going through some tough stuff.</p><p>We’re... in counseling.</p><p>Oh, really? More steak?</p><p>It’s her idea.</p><p>It’s not the most pleasant way to spend an hour.</p><p>Basically, I look at the clock and she blames me for everything.</p><p>I don’t think you should be talking about Alisa with her...</p><p>...So...</p><p>It’s ok, it’s not like she can hear.</p><p>Maybe I will have some more of that, uh, potato stuff.</p><p>He actually said those things, with her sitting right there?</p><p>It was really nasty, and he wouldn’t shut up, either.</p><p>I can’t believe you said we’d play tennis.</p><p>That was before I knew he was a jerk. She was great.</p><p>Look what she taught me.</p><p>It means ”I love you.” Yeah, that’s great. What am I gonna do?</p><p>- What do you mean? - Obviously she needs to be told.</p><p>No, no, no, she doesn’t. This is between Dennis and Alisa.</p><p>How can I ignore this?</p><p>And I quote, ”It’s not like she can hear.” Lynette, you’re starting to ramp up into that whole meddling thing you do.</p><p>- Excuse me? - Let me just handle it.</p><p>Let’s avoid a big thing.</p><p>Are you saying I can’t be tactful?</p><p>If he says something at tennis, I will take him aside, man to man, and say, ”that’s not cool.” Are you saying I’m not tactful?</p><p>Andrew, I need you to take out the trash.</p><p>- Sure. - Now, not five hours from now.</p><p>I’m going, I’m going. God...</p><p>Um, I’m meeting Justin at the mall tonight so I’m gonna need 40 bucks.</p><p>No.</p><p>- What? - You no longer get an allowance.</p><p>Fine. I’m not taking out the trash.</p><p>Andrew!</p><p>What are you gonna do? Torture me?</p><p>Go ahead, I can take it.</p><p>What I want, what I have always wanted, is for you to be happy.</p><p>And you’re not, and I have no idea how to help you.</p><p>Well, you could start by getting out of the way.</p><p>I will not. We’re gonna talk about this now.</p><p>I said, get out of the way.</p><p>The next time you touch your mother, I’ll throw you through this wall.</p><p>You understand me?</p><p>Oh, Edie, wait up. I wanna ask you something.</p><p>I can’t stop. I gotta keep my heart rate up.</p><p>I was just wondering how you’d feel if I went out with Bill.</p><p>- What? - Bill asked me out.</p><p>Bill? My Bill?</p><p>Well, see, that’s the thing.</p><p>He doesn’t think of himself as your Bill.</p><p>He said that date was just a one-time thing.</p><p>Which I know, because when he asked me out I told him I thought you guys were involved.</p><p>So you haven’t agreed to go out with him?</p><p>No, I wanted to check with you first.</p><p>Wow, that’s nice of you.</p><p>- So, can I? - No.</p><p>Edie! Edie, why can’t I go out with him?</p><p>Because I saw him first.</p><p>That’s a really third-grade thing to say.</p><p>You asked my permission, I said no.</p><p>That should be the end of it.</p><p>Well, you know.</p><p>Technically, I don’t need your permission.</p><p>You know, I so much wanna like you, but you just won’t let me.</p><p>Edie...</p><p>Susan, you know...I try. I try to look past your flaws.</p><p>Your klutziness. That... that...</p><p>...faux vulnerability. Your hair.</p><p>But you look for ways to push my buttons.</p><p>He just wants to buy me a burrito.</p><p>Susan, please. Let me like you.</p><p>Ok. I won’t go out with him.</p><p>I mean, obviously, you have feelings for him.</p><p>No, I don’t. I really don’t.</p><p>So what, then?</p><p>If you can’t have him, nobody can?</p><p>See? Now you’re thinking like a friend.</p><p>What a voice.</p><p>You have to hand it to the Catholics.</p><p>They do grief better than anyone.</p><p>How much did that horse and buggy set us back?</p><p>- Do you mind? - Being poor? A little.</p><p>Eyes front, padre.</p><p>I can’t believe Edie.</p><p>She doesn’t have dibs on every man on the planet.</p><p>If I wanna go out with Bill, I should be able to.</p><p>- I thought you weren’t even into him. - Neither is she.</p><p>If she’s not into him, why can’t I not be into him?</p><p>I’m gonna mourn now.</p><p>What’s going on?</p><p>- Why are we slowing down? - Because we’re almost there.</p><p>What is that?!</p><p>The family who owned it couldn’t afford the maintenance payment.</p><p>I got an amazing deal.</p><p>A crypt? You bought your mother a crypt?!</p><p>Quiet! You’re making a scene.</p><p>Oh, that’s it. I cannot be a part of this.</p><p>- I can’t do it. - Gabrielle!</p><p>Stop acting like a child!</p><p>Are we supposed to be following them?</p><p>I don’t know. Maybe it’s part of the ritual.</p><p>Go to hell, Carlos!</p><p>All right, people, we’re going to follow the body.</p><p>This way, please. Come along!</p><p>This is too much.</p><p>The only reason I agreed to give up the house because I thought I’d get a gorgeous little apartment.</p><p>Now I won’t even get that.</p><p>What do you want me to do?</p><p>- Take the plea. - What?</p><p>You did the crime. Why should I pay the price?</p><p>Just suck it up, be a man and do the time.</p><p>- Gaby, you’re being ridiculous. - Am I?</p><p>All I want is the same respect you gave your dead mother.</p><p>Gaby, please...!</p><p>At least she’s gonna have a roof over her head.</p><p>Fifteen all.</p><p>Oh, was that in?</p><p>Nice try.</p><p>Alisa, you’re deaf, not blind.</p><p>It was a close call.</p><p>That’s telling him.</p><p>I’m waiting for my moment.</p><p>You think her tennis stinks?</p><p>You should try her cooking.</p><p>Fifteen thirty.</p><p>Sorry.</p><p>I should have mentioned that my tennis is much better than my cooking.</p><p>That was fun. You play really well.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Gimme a break. She serves underhand, for god’s sake.</p><p>- What’s your problem? - Excuse me?</p><p>Hey, do you have any bottled water over there?</p><p>My electrolytes get all wacky when I sweat.</p><p>She’s your wife.</p><p>How can you talk about her like that?</p><p>Let me tell you what St Alisa is saying with that phony smile on her face.</p><p>”Move your ass, Dennis.” ”Nice love handles, Dennis.” ”Try switching deodorant, Dennis.” Enough. If you’ve got issues with your wife, tell her.</p><p>We’re in counseling.</p><p>It’s not working too well if you have to unload on a perfect stranger, is it?</p><p>If you’re unhappy in your marriage, do something instead of just complaining.</p><p>Cause, frankly, I don’t want to hear it.</p><p>Let’s trade partners.</p><p>- Sure. - Great!</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>I’ll play with you.</p><p>You did not take this in.</p><p>This should hold, but you’ve got to take it in.</p><p>Thank you. I know. I’m going to.</p><p>It’s on the top of my list.</p><p>That was hard work.</p><p>Would you like a glass of water and maybe an excuse to come in and talk to me?</p><p>Sounds great.</p><p>So... It’s tomorrow.</p><p>I told you I’d check back in on that date.</p><p>Bill, um... I have my reasons.</p><p>Am I... hideous?</p><p>Oh, god, no!</p><p>No, you are just so incredibly not hideous.</p><p>Thank you... I think.</p><p>See, maybe it’s the word ”date” that’s throwing me off.</p><p>Look, I just want to have some fun, you know? Dinner, drinks...</p><p>No strings attached.</p><p>Ok, I’ll go out with you.</p><p>Great. I know this little place out of the way. You’re gonna love it.</p><p>What are you doing?</p><p>Making an emergency list for you.</p><p>So you’ll know who to call in case the roof leaks, or the power goes out...</p><p>Why?</p><p>I’m taking the plea bargain.</p><p>So you can keep the house.</p><p>When I buried my mother, I did it with respect, and I don’t regret a single penny.</p><p>But I got us into the position we are in and the moment I did, I stopped respecting you.</p><p>- And that’s not right. - You’re so brave.</p><p>It’s not without strings.</p><p>I need you to promise you’re gonna be here when I get out.</p><p>That’s a ridiculous thing to say.</p><p>I’m not going anywhere.</p><p>And I need you to promise that you’ll be faithful while I’m gone.</p><p>Yeah. Of course.</p><p>Gabrielle, I’m no fool.</p><p>You’re a beautiful woman and I understand you have needs.</p><p>But I’m a very jealous and possessive man.</p><p>And I need to hear you say it.</p><p>I promise.</p><p>Ok, then.</p><p>Tomorrow morning, we’ll go and see the lawyers.</p><p>I love you.</p><p>I love you too.</p><p>And just so you know, I’m gonna hold you to that promise.</p><p>What’s going on? Did grandma die?</p><p>Uh, no, she’s fine. Listen, Andrew...</p><p>Sweetheart, it’s been clear to us for some time now that you’ve been unhappy.</p><p>- All this acting out. - The pot smoking, the violence...</p><p>It just isn’t you.</p><p>And we feel that you need to spend some quality time thinking about the goals in your life and what kind of person you want to be.</p><p>What the hell are you talking about?</p><p>There’s this place called Camp Hennessey.</p><p>It’s designed for teenagers like yourself who’ve lost their way.</p><p>You gotta be kidding.</p><p>They emphasize discipline and responsibility, two things you’re sorely in need of.</p><p>You’ll only be there more than a few weeks.</p><p>You can stop this now.</p><p>I’m not going to a stupid camp for juvenile delinquents.</p><p>We’re ready.</p><p>Sorry, honey, you don’t have a choice.</p><p>- Get your hands off of me! - Take it easy!</p><p>Andrew, Andrew, it’s no use fighting.</p><p>These gentlemen will help you dress and drive you to the camp.</p><p>- We can take it from here. - Wait, wait!</p><p>Mom, wait! Please, I’m sorry...</p><p>Honey, it’s gonna be ok, I promise.</p><p>- This was your idea. - Why, you...!</p><p>Stop it.</p><p>Honey, no matter what you say or do, I will always love you.</p><p>Let’s go. Come on.</p><p>What’s that for?</p><p>For being here.</p><p>For standing by me through this.</p><p>You don’t know what it means to me, Rex.</p><p>It’s been a long time since I felt like I had a real partner.</p><p>And it really helps, especially on a horrible morning like this.</p><p>Hey, Alisa. Hey, Lily. How are you guys?</p><p>May I speak to you, please?</p><p>Oh, sure. Boys, here.</p><p>Stay right there.</p><p>Yes, mom.</p><p>- So how are you? - Dennis left me.</p><p>What?</p><p>Dennis left me!</p><p>Why?!</p><p>You told him to, you moron!</p><p>- I’m sorry? - You talked about our marriage.</p><p>- It’s none of your business. - Stop.</p><p>I can’t understand you. You’re gonna have to talk slower.</p><p>Dennis said you yelled at him for saying stuff behind my back.</p><p>Well, yeah.</p><p>And he said you told him our counseling wasn’t working.</p><p>Yes, that’s not exactly what I...</p><p>Where the hell do you come off telling him we are stop to going to conseling?</p><p>- I didn’t mean... - Sure, We have our share of problems, financial, emotional, sexual.</p><p>But we were solving them.</p><p>Alisa, come here.</p><p>Are you sure you wanna be...</p><p>saying these things in front of your daughter?</p><p>Now you’re telling me how to raise my daughter?!</p><p>Lily, we’re coming back.</p><p>Listen, Alisa, I am so sorry if I caused a problem.</p><p>I just wanted to help.</p><p>Why? Why did you want to help?</p><p>- Well, because... - Oh, because I was deaf?</p><p>No. Because your husband was being a total jerk.</p><p>And you’ve just gotta come in on your white horse and come to the rescue.</p><p>Well, guess what? I didn’t need to be rescued. Got that?</p><p>I didn’t need to be rescued.</p><p>Bitch.</p><p>Uh, she said...</p><p>Yes, thank you. I know what she just said.</p><p>One minute we’re making out in his truck, and next thing I know we’re at the hospital and the doctor’s digging a bullet out of him.</p><p>It’s just that when I started dating Mike, he seemed like such a normal guy, you know?</p><p>They always do. You wanna get some nachos?</p><p>I mean obviously, I am not going to read the letter.</p><p>At some point, you’ve just gotta let it go, right?</p><p>Right.</p><p>Mind if we leave off the jalapenos?</p><p>I’m not good with spicy things.</p><p>I don’t mean to babble. It’s complicated.</p><p>And there is so much about Mike you don’t even know.</p><p>That would surprise me at this point.</p><p>Edie.</p><p>Your foreman said you were on a date with a hottie.</p><p>Evidently, someone needs lasik.</p><p>- You tracked us down? - It wasn’t hard.</p><p>I just followed the stench of betrayal.</p><p>- We had an agreement, Susan. - No, we didn’t.</p><p>I said what you wanted to hear because you guilted me into it.</p><p>I was trying to protect our already fragile friendship.</p><p>- Am I in the middle of something here? - Not any more.</p><p>You, I will hate forever.</p><p>And you are fired.</p><p>Edie!</p><p>You’re firing me for going out with Susan?</p><p>Yes. And before you start whining that dating her is punishment enough.</p><p>Save it.</p><p>I suppose I could tell her you threw yourself at me.</p><p>You were lonely, begged to have dinner.</p><p>I took pity on you.</p><p>Well, excuse me, but that kinda makes it sound like it was my fault.</p><p>You can’t possibly blame me. I’m not the one who fired you.</p><p>Right. You just chose not to tell me Edie would be insanely mad if I went out with you.</p><p>Slow down. You’re driving too fast.</p><p>You know. This is between you and Edie.</p><p>I just got sucked into the drama.</p><p>Yeah. I bet you say that to yourself all the time.</p><p>What does that mean?</p><p>You didn’t get sucked into the drama. You invited it in.</p><p>That’s not true.</p><p>You’ve spent an hour obsessing over your ex-boyfriend, even though he’s an ex-con who very possibly strangled your neighbor.</p><p>No, he didn’t.</p><p>And Edie told you not to go out with me, but did you listen? No.</p><p>Because you saw the potential for disaster and couldn’t resist getting in there.</p><p>Ok, Mr-let’s-just-have-fun- because-I’m-the-casual-contractor-man, you chased me, so own it, my friend.</p><p>You didn’t get that tire fixed, did you?</p><p>I was meaning to.</p><p>I guess I do invite the drama in.</p><p>Just a little.</p><p>Tom, am I a bad person?</p><p>No. Why would you say that?</p><p>I don’t know. I guess I just have it in my head that only bad people break up marriages and offend the handicapped.</p><p>- I did try to warn you. - You did.</p><p>Why do I do it?</p><p>This compulsion to stick my nose where it doesn’t belong.</p><p>Honey, you were just looking out for your friend.</p><p>A lot of good it did her.</p><p>At least you tried. I admire you for that.</p><p>Oh, please.</p><p>Hey, I’m the guy who let Dennis bad-mouth his wife because I was afraid of making a scene.</p><p>You knew it was wrong and you let him have it.</p><p>That’s me. I’m never afraid to create a scene.</p><p>Hey, honey, look. My point is, you have a strong sense of what is right and you’re not afraid to act on it.</p><p>And I admire you for that.</p><p>You know what I admire you for?</p><p>You find a way to compliment me when you could say, ”I told you so.” You just signed ”I told you so,” didn’t you?</p><p>You’ll never prove it.</p><p>Thanks for coming in, Mrs. Solis.</p><p>I believe you’ve met nurse Hisel?</p><p>Yes. Hello. Again.</p><p>Nurse Hisel became quite attached to your mother-in-law.</p><p>That’s why I asked her to be here for this.</p><p>First, I want you to understand that we consider our commitment to our patients a sacred trust.</p><p>Ok.</p><p>Having said that, it appears that there may, and I stress may, have been a breakdown in our chain of care.</p><p>I can assure you we hold our staff to the highest standards in the industry.</p><p>But we are only human after all.</p><p>Honey, are you ok?</p><p>Nurse Hisel, why don’t you step out?</p><p>I’m so sorry.</p><p>We all share in your grief.</p><p>Apparently.</p><p>And we’re hoping to alleviate any further pain your family may suffer by offering some...</p><p>...monetary compensation.</p><p>Provided you and your husband waive any future right to litigation, of course.</p><p>Monetary compensation?</p><p>You’re trying to buy us off?</p><p>Let’s not get tangled up in legalese.</p><p>We like to think of it as an extension of our caring.</p><p>Well, in that case, care away.</p><p>Mr. Hartley, I have a hypothetical legal question for you.</p><p>I like to play the lottery and I...</p><p>Yes, I know what the odds are but I just love those scratch-offs.</p><p>Say I were to win, I don’t know, a million, six hundred thousand dollars.</p><p>Would the government be able to take it like they took everything else?</p><p>That’s what I thought. The bastards.</p><p>So what if we won the lottery after Carlos went to jail?</p><p>Could the government touch the money then? Hypothetically.</p><p>I see.</p><p>And we could keep the house.</p><p>Oh, no, I’m just at the grocery store, wondering if I should buy a ticket.</p><p>Thanks a bunch, Mr. Hartley.</p><p>So what time should I bring Carlos to the DA’s office tomorrow?</p><p>Great.</p><p>We all honor heroes for different reasons.</p><p>Sometimes for their daring.</p><p>Sometimes for their bravery.</p><p>Sometimes for their goodness.</p><p>I love you.</p><p>But mostly, we honor heroes because at one point or another, we all dream of being rescued.</p><p>Of course, if the right hero doesn’t come along, sometimes, we just have to rescue ourselves.</p>',615),i=[n];function s(h,r,u,l,d,y){return o(),t("div",null,i)}const g=e(a,[["render",s]]);export{w as __pageData,g as default};
