Why would you keep it?</p><p>Questions were asked.</p><p>- Are you ok? - I think he’s hiding something.</p><p>And lots of evidence was uncovered.</p><p>What is it you hired me to do?</p><p>Someone sent that note to my wife.</p><p>I need to know who.</p><p>You like Alfred Hitchcock?</p><p>I found it in the ruins of Edie’s home.</p><p>I found it under our bed. It’s not mine.</p><p>Talk about dirty laundry.</p><p>Every neighborhood has a woman like Alberta Frome.</p><p>And every woman like Mrs. Frome has a cat.</p><p>When she traveled, Mrs. Frome would arrange for friends to look after her beloved pet.</p><p>This time, however, she was forced to ask her neighbor, Susan Mayer.</p><p>Mrs. Frome liked Susan.</p><p>But it was common knowledge on Wisteria Lane, where Susan Mayer went, bad luck was sure to follow.</p><p>Her misfortunes ranged from the commonplace...</p><p>...to the unusual...</p><p>...to the truly bizarre.</p><p>As she waved goodbye, she worried that Susan’s bad luck would continue.</p><p>For that matter, so did her cat.</p><p>Mr. Whiskers. Dinner time.</p><p>Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.</p><p>That’s weird. Cats can’t open drawers, can they?</p><p>- Are you sure you didn’t leave them open? - No way.</p><p>Wow. Do you think somebody broke in?</p><p>Mr. Whiskers?</p><p>Mr. Whiskers?</p><p>Though she didn’t know it at the time, Susan’s luck... had finally started to change.</p><p>News that an intruder had breached the security of Wisteria Lane spread like wildfire.</p><p>At a neighborhood watch meeting the next night, residents voiced their concerns over the increasing dangers their community faced.</p><p>Mrs. Ida Grenberg said someone was looking through her bathroom window whenever she took a shower.</p><p>Bob Fisk warned those present that a government agency was listening in on their phone conversations.</p><p>Helen Vale spoke of a ruthless local tenage gang that had egged her minivan.</p><p>Three factors contribute to...</p><p>The evening concluded with Officer Thompson offering safety tips and a plan of action.</p><p>...The oppoutunity you have some control over.</p><p>You can sign up for daily or nightly patrols, which might seem like overkill, but I guarantee regular surveillance will deter even the most determined criminal.</p><p>Are there any other questions?</p><p>All right. Let’s be careful out there.</p><p>Actually, I do have a question. Do you have a second?</p><p>Sure. How can I help?</p><p>Um... I’m the one who discovered the break-in.</p><p>- I think I found some evidence. - Evidence?</p><p>This is a screwdriver left behind by the burglar.</p><p>I didn’t touch it.</p><p>Why didn’t you give this to the investigators?</p><p>I tried and they sort of laughed at me.</p><p>Because apparently nothing was taken from Mrs. Frome’s house.</p><p>I apologize for that. That was totally unprofessional.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>So you think it should be dusted for prints?</p><p>- Yes. And I’ll make sure it gets done. - Great.</p><p>Bye.</p><p>Boys, stop it! Go to bed!</p><p>- We’re not tired! - Well, at least go upstairs.</p><p>- We want to play! - Look!</p><p>Gimme!</p><p>Go! Go!</p><p>So why weren’t you sitting with Mike?</p><p>I thought you two were an item.</p><p>I sort of thought so too.</p><p>Getting a lot of mixed signals.</p><p>I’ll tell you who wasn’t giving mixed signals.</p><p>Sexy officer Thompson.</p><p>He stared at you all night.</p><p>You noticed that?</p><p>Honey, trust me, when they’re not staring at me, I notice.</p><p>I appreciate you guys staying and helping.</p><p>Oh, please. I would have hosted it myself but there’s camping equipment everywhere.</p><p>It’s nice of you.</p><p>And there’s something else nice that I’d like you to do.</p><p>Your kids both went to Barcliff Academy, didn’t they?</p><p>We need you to recommend Porter and Preston.</p><p>We can’t get an interview.</p><p>You want me to recommend the twins?</p><p>Yes. You can tell them how beautifully behaved the boys are.</p><p>- So you want me to lie? - Yeah.</p><p>I thought that was understood.</p><p>I’m very well respected at Barcliff, and my word won’t be good there any more.</p><p>Yes, but by the time they realize their mistake, we’ll be in.</p><p>You’re not having any more kids. What do you care?</p><p>I had hoped some day to get my grandchildren into Barcliff.</p><p>But I suppose that doesn’t matter to you, does it?</p><p>It really doesn’t.</p><p>We’ve got to get rid of it.</p><p>- I said leave it alone! - No! You can’t stop me!</p><p>Paul and Zach are fighting again.</p><p>The second time this week.</p><p>They never fought when Mary Alice was alive.</p><p>It’s a shame. They used to be such a happy family.</p><p>Just because you didn’t hear them fighting, doesn’t mean they were happy.</p><p>The next day, as residents began to patrol Wisteria Lane in the hopes of foiling potential burglars, Gabrielle was about to experience a home invasion of her own.</p><p>Mama Solis! What are you doing here?</p><p>I came to visit my son and daughter-in-law.</p><p>What does it look like?</p><p>Does Carlos know you’re coming?</p><p>No. He likes to be surprised.</p><p>Now come.</p><p>Gabrielle. Come.</p><p>Family should always hug...</p><p>... regardless of how they feel about each other.</p><p>Wow. She’s a beauty. 30-footer?</p><ol start="32"><li></li></ol><p>Sweet. I sail. I’ve got a flying Scott.</p><p>We have several yachting enthusiasts here in Barcliff Academy.</p><p>I could introduce them to you...</p><p>That sounds great.</p><p>...if we decide to enroll your children.</p><p>To be honest, Mr. And Mrs. Scavo, your children’s educational background is a bit more common than we would prefer.</p><p>But Mrs. Van de Kamp said they were identical twins?</p><p>Yes. Completely identically. You can’t tell them apart.</p><p>They’re like book ends.</p><p>We do strive for diversity at Barcliff.</p><p>Identical twins could be interesting.</p><p>The boys are fascinating. They even have their own twin secret language.</p><p>Yeah, it’s pretty scary.</p><p>Not so much scary as highly developed.</p><p>Yeah, they bark and growl at each other.</p><p>Tom, Mr. Lentz was trying to say something.</p><p>Sorry. Go ahead, Mr. Lentz.</p><p>I’d love to meet these twins of yours.</p><p>I tell you what.</p><p>I’m going to put them on our ”must-meet list”.</p><p>- Terrific! - Thank you so much.</p><p>What is a ”must-meet list”?</p><p>We bring them in for observation.</p><p>Observation?</p><p>Mm. To see how they play with the other children, how they respond to authority, that sort of thing.</p><p>- Great. - That sounds wonderful.</p><p>Kids ready?</p><p>Almost. Thanks for driving them.</p><p>Happy to do it. I miss them.</p><p>Did you hear there was a break-in at Mrs. Frome’s the other night?</p><p>Yeah. I heard they didn’t take anything.</p><p>It’s still frightening.</p><p>He could have been a sexual predator.</p><p>And he ended up at Mrs. Frome’s?</p><p>That would have been a lose-lose situation.</p><p>Rex, that’s not the point.</p><p>I don’t feel safe. I was wondering if you could spend the night.</p><p>You’re in the NRA. You own four guns.</p><p>If somebody broke in I’d expect you to protect me.</p><p>Rex, the truth is, with the kids gone, I’ll be all by myself in this house for the first time in 17 years.</p><p>I know it’s hard to hear, but the marriage counseling might not work out.</p><p>You need to get used to being alone.</p><p>You’re right. That was hard to hear.</p><p>- What are you doing? - That is for the kids’ trip.</p><p>Oh, come on. I’m staying at a motel.</p><p>I haven’t had a decent meal in weeks.</p><p>Honey, the marriage counseling might not work out.</p><p>You need to get used to bad cooking.</p><p>Hey. Screwdriver girl.</p><p>I took your evidence into the lab for fingerprints.</p><p>Really? That’s great.</p><p>- I’ll call you if I hear something. - Ok.</p><p>- Sorry! - Thanks.</p><p>Actually, I’d like to call you anyway if that’s ok.</p><p>Oh. You seem like a really sweet guy in an interesting line of work but I’m not really available.</p><p>- Oh. You have a boyfriend? - Yeah, sort of.</p><p>- Sort of. - It’s hard to explain. Even to myself.</p><p>Unit 23, we have a 907A in progress.</p><p>Please respond.</p><p>Ten-four. I’m on my way. I gotta go.</p><p>Apparently there’s a hostage situation.</p><p>So you’re really turning me down?</p><p>- Boy. My self-esteem can’t take this. - I’m sorry.</p><p>No, it’s just, now my ability to help those hostages has been compromised.</p><p>- Still, don’t blame yourself for what might happen. - Blame myself?</p><p>Yeah. It’s just hard to rescue folks when you don’t feel good about yourself.</p><p>Ah, they’ll probably all die anyway.</p><p>Ok, fine. I’ll go out with you.</p><p>Great. I’ll call you.</p><p>Now that you’ve got your date, you can tell me what 907A really means.</p><p>Someone’s TV was playing too loud.</p><p>Thank god for The Thin Blue Line.</p><p>I’ll call you.</p><p>I’ll be outside doing my yoga.</p><p>I’ll be right back.</p><p>Do you have to do that now? My mother’s here.</p><p>I’m not gonna stop my life just just because she decides to shows up unannounced on my add.</p><p>She’s family. She doesn’t need an invitation.</p><p>Whatever. It’s rude.</p><p>It’s real pretty, mama.</p><p>You were always good with your hands.</p><p>So, I assume you didn’t insist that I travel 2,000 miles for small talk.</p><p>So why am I here?</p><p>She...</p><p>...is unhappy.</p><p>I’ve given her everything she ever wanted, but it doesn’t seem to make a difference.</p><p>I feel her drifting further and further away.</p><p>And lately I’ve started thinking that maybe...</p><p>So you think she’s cheating on you?</p><p>I think so.</p><p>We can talk about your problems, but I’m not gonna have any of that.</p><p>Do you have any proof?</p><p>No. It’s just a feeling.</p><p>I had that feeling with your father and that whore waitress.</p><p>And I was right. Always trust your feelings.</p><p>So what do I do?</p><p>You don’t do anything.</p><p>I’ll take care of it.</p><p>Thank you, mama.</p><p>I’m sorry I had to hit you, but we’re strong people.</p><p>We don’t cry about our problems.</p><p>We find ways to fix them.</p><p>While the residents of Wisteria Lane kept up their patrols in an effort to prevent future break-ins, Lynette hatched a plan to break her children into Barcliff Academy.</p><p>Boys, wake up.</p><p>Come on. We’re gonna have some fun today.</p><p>- Come on. - Mom. Hi.</p><p>Come on! I bet you can beat me! Come on!</p><p>Go, go, go! Yes, yes, yes! Mush!</p><p>Mush! Mush! Mush!</p><p>Mom, I’m tired.</p><p>If I can still see your head, the pool’s not deep enough.</p><p>Are your boys usually so docile?</p><p>They’re always a little shy at first.</p><p>Look at that concentration.</p><p>Porter loves his puzzles.</p><p>Mama, I’ll be right back. I’m going to the store.</p><p>Gabrielle! I’m coming with you.</p><p>I want to make some tamales for Carlos.</p><p>No, I’m not going to the supermarket.</p><p>I’m going to the lingerie store.</p><p>- Good. I need some bras. - I’m gonna be a while.</p><p>I might get a facial.</p><p>I have a face.</p><p>- Hey, Mike. - How’s it going?</p><p>- Good. Just came by to say hello. - Hello.</p><p>So you remember the cop from the neighborhood watch meeting?</p><p>He agreed to run a fingerprint check on the screwdriver I found at Mrs. Frome’s house.</p><p>He did? Nothing was taken.</p><p>Still, somebody broke in. It is a crime.</p><p>So the weird thing is the cop asked me out, on a date.</p><p>And I sort of said yes.</p><p>I was just curious what you thought about that.</p><p>You’re asking my permission to go out with him?</p><p>No. No, I just uh...</p><p>was wondering your opinion.</p><p>I don’t really have one.</p><p>Ok. Great.</p><p>Fine.</p><p>- Thank you. - Susan, wait. Wait, I...</p><p>I’m sorry.</p><p>My life is just really complicated right now.</p><p>You don’t have to explain.</p><p>- Susan. - It’s complicated. I get it.</p><p>Paul? Paul?</p><p>Oh. Hi, Zachary. Sorry, the door was open and...</p><p>It’s ok. You can come in.</p><p>Is your father here? We’re scheduled to do a patrol today.</p><p>He had to go out of town. Again.</p><p>Oh. Well, I guess I can do it by myself.</p><p>Wow. This place is just immaculate.</p><p>My mom liked things clean.</p><p>She would be very proud of you.</p><p>What happened to your varnish?</p><p>That’s where my mother died.</p><p>I messed up the floor trying to get out the blood.</p><p>- I’ll tell my dad that you stopped by. - Ok.</p><p>Zach, do you have plans for dinner?</p><p>- So you shop a lot, huh? - Yeah. So?</p><p>Most women that shop a lot, it’s because they don’t have anything better to do.</p><p>- What’s your point? - Well, if you had children...</p><p>Here we go.</p><p>I’m just saying that children give your life a purpose.</p><p>You’re so busy taking care of them you don’t have time to wonder if you’re happy.</p><p>You know, Juanita, this is so like you.</p><p>I invite you on a nice shopping trip and you find ways to upset me.</p><p>You didn’t invite me. I invited myself.</p><p>You keep looking at your watch.</p><p>Is there some place you have to be?</p><p>No! And I am not one of those women who has a hole in her heart that can only be filled by a baby.</p><p>I like my life a lot. It’s very fulfilling.</p><p>Excuse my daughter-in-law. She’s very fulfilled.</p><p>So he just blew you off?</p><p>I told him another man asked me out.</p><p>It was a perfect opportunity for Mike to be jealous, and nothing.</p><p>Did you bat your eyes? It doesn’t work if you don’t bat your eyes.</p><p>I batted everything that wasn’t nailed down. Nothing.</p><p>- Thanks. - So what’s going on there?</p><p>Gophers.</p><p>I’m sorry about Mike. I know you like him.</p><p>Maybe it’s my fault.</p><p>Maybe I just imagined an entire relationship with this man that didn’t exist.</p><p>There has been flirting. I have seen it.</p><p>And the flirting made me think he was kind, trustworthy, honest and hygienic.</p><p>A guy just smiles at me three times and I’m picking out wedding china.</p><p>I’m a mess.</p><p>But to be fair, that’s part of your charm.</p><p>That’s what happened with Karl.</p><p>I only dated him a couple of months.</p><p>I filled in the blankets, I married him.</p><p>It was a disaster.</p><p>You think Mike is a Karl in disguise?</p><p>I don’t know. What does that mean anyway?</p><p>”My life is complicated.” If I wanted to sit around and wait for nothing, I could do it on the can.</p><p>You’re late. What’s with the face?</p><p>I screwed up. I broke into the Frome house and almost got caught.</p><p>What’s ”almost”?</p><p>I accidentally left something behind with my prints on it.</p><p>- Did you ever hear of gloves? - It’s the suburbs.</p><p>I didn’t think it’d matter.</p><p>Anyway, the police are running a check and I’m in the system.</p><p>I gotta pull up stakes before they come looking for me.</p><p>That’s a sweet sound. Laughter like that, huh?</p><p>Pisses me off.</p><p>If and when your cover is blown, you disappear.</p><p>Until then, you keep fixing the neighbors’ pipes.</p><p>The more time I spend at this town, the more I think we’re making a mistake.</p><p>These are nice people.</p><p>My money says one of them isn’t.</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>No more screw-ups.</p><p>I’m getting something to drink. Do you want something?</p><p>- Don’t be mad. - I waited for three hours for you.</p><p>I had to use a month’s worth of lunch money to pay for that room.</p><p>It’s not my fault.</p><p>Juanita hasn’t let me out of her sight since she got here.</p><p>Really? Well, I don’t see her now.</p><p>She’s watching her Mexican soap opera.</p><p>The rebel’s virgin daughter is about to be seduced by the escaped desperado.</p><p>So until she puts out, Juanita won’t even know that I’m gone.</p><p>Come on. I said I was sorry.</p><p>Just so you know, I’ve turned down half the pep-squad for you.</p><p>You can’t be serious.</p><p>I’m starting to think that... maybe I should be with someone my own age.</p><p>I thought teenage girls bored you, John.</p><p>I thought what we had was beyond that.</p><p>so did I.</p><p>Why go back to something you don’t want?</p><p>- I don’t know. - Maybe you’re tired of me.</p><p>No. I want to be with you.</p><p>Then why are we arguing?</p><p>- Gabrielle! - Damn it!</p><p>The virgin gave it up already?</p><p>I want you so bad.</p><p>- When can I see you again? - Tomorrow.</p><p>Meet me at the mall after school.</p><p>- What about your mother-in-law? - I’ll think of something.</p><p>- Gabrielle! Gabrielle! - Coming!</p><p>A donation? Now Barcliff wants a donation?</p><p>Apparently we’re in competition with one other family.</p><p>A generous donation will ensure our kids beat ’em out.</p><p>- How generous? - 15 thousand.</p><p>- We don’t have that. - That’s what I told them.</p><p>So what will we do? Public school is out unless we move to a new district.</p><p>We’re not moving.</p><p>Maybe it’s time that we look into home schooling.</p><p>I know you did not just say that.</p><p>Honey, it’s got its advantages.</p><p>Kids at home school do better in their later years.</p><p>They won’t make it to their later years if I have to spend all day with them.</p><p>Honey, sometimes you’ve just got to make the sacrifice.</p><p>It’s probably the best thing for the kids.</p><p>Why don’t we just put them back in me and cook them until they’re civilized.</p><p>You’d be cool with that?</p><p>I’ve never had plum pudding before.</p><p>I’m serving it for christmas.</p><p>I like to try out new recipes before the actual holiday.</p><p>That way, if the cookbook’s gotten it wrong, I can fix it.</p><p>You must really like Christmas.</p><p>You and Mr. Van de Kamp always have the best decorations.</p><p>I adore the holidays.</p><p>I never get depressed if there’s a decorated tree.</p><p>My mom and I would always decorate our tree together.</p><p>- This Christmas is gonna be weird. - Oh, Zach.</p><p>You know, my mother died when I was young. She was hit by a car.</p><p>It was right before Christmas, as a matter of fact.</p><p>We were all singing carols and the dog was howling because everybody in my family sings off-key except for me.</p><p>Anyway, it was a terrible ruckus.</p><p>So no one noticed when my mother went out to give the neighbors a gift.</p><p>The next thing we heard were brakes screeching.</p><p>Most of my family went to the hospital but I stayed home because I was so young.</p><p>When I looked out the window I saw my mother’s blood on the street and nobody was doing anything about it.</p><p>So I got a hose and I washed it off.</p><p>And once it was clean, I felt so much better.</p><p>I’ve never told anyone that story before.</p><p>Those are the most interesting ones.</p><p>The stories that we never tell anyone.</p><p>Yeah. You’re probably right.</p><p>I have one.</p><p>It’s more of a secret really.</p><p>I know why my mom killed herself.</p><p>- You do? - It was something I did.</p><p>Something bad.</p><p>What did you do, Zach?</p><p>Zach. Sweetheart.</p><p>No. I shouldn’t have said anything.</p><p>If my dad found out...</p><p>I won’t tell your father!</p><p>I can’t get you involved.</p><p>Zachary, it’s all right!</p><p>I can’t believe Zach said that.</p><p>What else did Zach tell you?</p><p>Just that Mary Alice killed herself because of something he’d done.</p><p>You couldn’t get any more out of him?</p><p>Oh, I tired, but he was so nervous.</p><p>He actually started shaking then he just left.</p><p>Ok, this is getting really weird.</p><p>I think we should go to the police.</p><p>And tell them what?</p><p>We don’t even have the note any more. We gave it to Paul.</p><p>You have to get Zach to tell you something so we have more to go on.</p><p>Girls, You don’t understand.</p><p>This poor kid is scared out of his mind.</p><p>Bree, for god’s sakes, you’re a woman.</p><p>Manipulate him. That’s what we do.</p><p>But how?</p><p>I don’t know. How did you usually manipulate Rex?</p><p>Hello, Zachary.</p><p>Are you free for dinner tonight?</p><p>Sure.</p><p>Oh, good. Because last night you put me in such a holiday mood.</p><p>I’m gonna make roast turkey and candy yams and eggnog.</p><p>Have you ever had real, old-fashioned eggnog?</p><p>- I don’t think so. - You are gonna love it.</p><p>It has quite a kick.</p><p>Mine!</p><p>- Preston! - Boys, could you stop...</p><p>Lynette was desperate to avoid home schooling.</p><p>But she saw no options on the horizon.</p><p>Until a solution sailed into view.</p><p>Gabrielle, please. You bought me enough things.</p><p>You’re the one who’s supposed to be shopping.</p><p>Mama, you’re in a rut.</p><p>We need to spice up your wardrobe. Ooh. Here.</p><p>Try this one on. Go on. Try it on.</p><p>Mama Solis, how are you doing in there?</p><p>Is it supposed to be so tight?</p><p>Yes, it’s form-fitting. You’ll look great.</p><p>Gabrielle, I don’t think this dress is right for me.</p><p>I can’t breathe.</p><p>Well, maybe I made a mistake.</p><p>While you change, I’m gonna make a quick run to the book store.</p><p>Wait! I’m coming with you!</p><p>No! I’ll just be a minute!</p><p>I’m coming with you!</p><p>Wait!</p><p>- Gabrielle! Wait! - Ma’am!</p><p>Ma’am. Sorry, I’m gonna need to look in your bags, please.</p><p>Fine. Just hurry up.</p><p>Right on time.</p><p>I don’t know where that blouse came from.</p><p>- Security. - Keep your stupid blouse.</p><p>I have to find my daughter-in-law.</p><p>Don’t touch me. Don’t you dare touch me!</p><p>Ma’am, you have to come with us.</p><p>Get your hands off me! Gabrielle!</p><p>Hello.</p><p>- Hey, it’s me. - Oh, hi, Rex. How are you?</p><p>Is something wrong?</p><p>I was just about to grab dinner from that motel vending machine and it occurred to me, ”what the heck? I’ll go out.” Would you like to have dinner with me?</p><p>Mrs. Van de Kamp. Guess what.</p><p>I found all my mom’s old Christmas stuff.</p><p>Oh. Sweetie, I was just coming over to talk to you.</p><p>I am so sorry but something important came up and I have to cancel.</p><p>- Really? - We’ll do it again.</p><p>We’ll have our impromptu holiday dinner. I promise.</p><p>Bye.</p><p>Mm. I got one. Kelly Halstatter.</p><p>In eighth grade, she used to spit in my gym shoes.</p><p>Kelly Halstatter.</p><p>Kelly Halstatter. Here, look.</p><p>Two duis, one check-kiting and an open bench warrant.</p><p>How tragic. By which I mean, ”yay”.</p><p>You’ve been a good sport coming on my shift with me.</p><p>Well, time flies when you’re on a stakeout in cracktown.</p><p>So when does our official date begin?</p><p>Taxpayers say 20 minutes. But I say now.</p><p>- They’re down. - Thank you.</p><p>Honey, you read up on home schooling?</p><p>Yeah. It gave me some good ideas.</p><p>Well, one, anyway.</p><p>Great. What have you got?</p><p>You know how we both agree that one of us needs to stay home and parent the kids and one of us needs to make a living?</p><p>And then I suddenly remembered that when I was working I made a little more than you.</p><p>What are you doing?</p><p>You tossed out that little sacrifice comment a while ago.</p><p>It occurred to me, I’ve made sacrifices over the past six years.</p><p>I gave up my career.</p><p>If another sacrifice has to be made, I think it’s your turn on the man go round.</p><p>- Lynette? - So if I went back to work, you could stay home and take care of the kids.</p><p>I can’t be with the kids all day. I’d lose my mind.</p><p>Hey. Ok, I get it. Home schooling is out.</p><p>How are we gonna scrape together 15 grand for this endowment?</p><p>Mm. How, how, how...</p><p>Think. Think real hard.</p><p>- Oh, no. - Aye-aye.</p><p>The restaurant’s run by this little old guy named Arinello.</p><p>He will propose to you. Don’t say yes because he’s dead serious.</p><p>But what if I like him?</p><p>Hey. I thought this went to the lab.</p><p>All right. You got me.</p><p>- And that means what? - Look, Susan.</p><p>No one would authorize lab time or a computer search for a case like this.</p><p>- It’s just not a priority. - So why couldn’t you just tell me that?</p><p>Well, I thought we were clicking.</p><p>Does this need to be a big deal?</p><p>Well, if you’d only lied to me about it once it wouldn’t be.</p><p>All right. I get it. You want me to beg. Ok.</p><p>Look at me. I’m begging.</p><p>Come on. Don’t be such a girl about this.</p><p>I know who you are. You’re a Karl in disguise.</p><p>I’m done with you. All of you.</p><p>Oh, come on, drama queen. What are you doing?</p><p>Where are you going?
