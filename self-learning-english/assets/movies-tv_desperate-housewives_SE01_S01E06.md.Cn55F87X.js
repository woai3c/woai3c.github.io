I think we should go to the police.</p><p>Relationships got complicated.</p><p>Mama Solis. What are you doing here?</p><p>You think she’s cheating on you? I think so.</p><p>I will take care of itWe got a call, something about a break-in.</p><p>I thought I’ve seen a lot on the jobbut this is something else.</p><p>And the mystery... Zach, why did you do this?</p><p>I don’t know. Depened.</p><p>Zach.</p><p>Suburbia is a battle ground,an arena for all forms of domestic combat.</p><p>Husbands clash with wives,parents cross swords with children.</p><p>But the bloodiest battles often involve womenand their mothers-in-law.</p><p>The war for control of Carlos began the night he proposed,and Gabrielle had been losing ground to Juanita ever since.</p><p>From the prenuptial agrement which she reluctantly signed...</p><p>to the selection of wedding music she despised...</p><p>to the color of the house paint she hadn’t wanted,Gabrielle had suffered one defeat after another.</p><p>And now that Juanita suspected herdaughter-in-law of having an affair,it had become increasingly apparent, in this warMrs. Solis, I’ll be at the market.</p><p>No prisoners would be taken.</p><p>Thank you, Yao Lin.</p><p>I don’t see why you have her.</p><p>It’s a big house. I need help.</p><p>It’s only called helpwhen you do some of the work yourself.</p><p>I supervise.</p><p>You pay her $ 300 a week.</p><p>That’s $ 15,000 a year.</p><p>Carlos, you always say you’re notputting away enough for retirement.</p><p>Baby, it would be a good idea to cut back on expenses.</p><p>You want me to take care of this place alone?</p><p>Other women manage.</p><p>That’s nice.</p><p>You like that? Oh, yeah.</p><p>God, I’m gonna miss this, Carlos.</p><p>What do you mean?</p><p>Well, since I’m gonna have to be doing the cookingand the cleaning and all the shopping like the other wives,I’m gonna be exhausted at night,just like all the other wives.</p><p>Till I build up my stamina, of course.</p><p>And that might take a couple of years.</p><p>Sadly for Juanita,she had ignored the first rule of war...</p><p>Good morning, Carlos. The maid stays.</p><p>Never underestimate your enemy.</p><p>Of the many suburban rituals,none is quite so cherished as the neighborhood yard sale.</p><p>The shoppers come to sift throughthe discarded belongings of someone they don’t really know,in hopes of finding bargains they don’t really need,each so determined to save a few penniesThey often miss hidden treasures.</p><p>Hey, Paul. Hi, Susan.</p><p>I was a little surprised to see Mary Alice’s award for sale.</p><p>She got it for doing charity work from the Chamber of Commerce.</p><p>Zach and I are moving.</p><p>We don’t need to carry any more than is necessary.</p><p>That makes sense.</p><p>I just wanted to make sure you didn’t want it for Zach.</p><p>Something to remember his mother by.</p><p>Zach doesn’t need a piece of glass to remember his mother.</p><p>I’m out of newspaper. Here.</p><p>Let’s call it ten bucks for everything.</p><p>Great. Speaking of Zach... I haven’t seen him around lately.</p><p>He’s been a bit depressed.</p><p>I thought he could use a change of scenery,so I sent him to stay with relatives.</p><p>Oh. Which ones? You don’t know them.</p><p>How did you get the fat lip? The usual wayasking too many questions.</p><p>Did you find out where Zach is? No.</p><p>But I can tell this much you he’s not staying with relatives.</p><p>She’s driven me crazy, mama.</p><p>It could be any one of these guys she’s having an affair with.</p><p>Don’t worry about it. I’m not letting her out of my sight.</p><p>Who the hell is that?</p><p>Look the way she is touching him.</p><p>Do you think that’s the guy she’s having an affair with?</p><p>Carlos, don’t be stupit with that.</p><p>A guy she talks to in publicisn’t someone you’re gonna worry about.</p><p>So it’s someone that she doesn’t talk to.</p><p>What I have to do, beat up every guy in town?</p><p>Marriage takes work.</p><p>I’m not surprise that he’s playing it close to the vest.</p><p>Paul knows we’re onto him.</p><p>Zach said Mary Alice killed herselfbecause of something he’d done. Something bad.</p><p>Is there anyone else who’d know what he was talking about?</p><p>No. That’s why we have to find him.</p><p>It’s the only way we’ll know the truth.</p><p>It just doesn’t make any sense. Zach is such a sweet kid.</p><p>I can’t imagine him doing anything that terrible.</p><p>He did break into your house.</p><p>I mean the kid’s obviously troubled in some way.</p><p>Severe depression, borderline personality disorder.</p><p>Zach is a deeply troubled young man. I’m aware of that.</p><p>What are you giving him?</p><p>Antidepressants and a mood stabilizer.</p><p>Good.</p><p>I’m also recommending extensive psychotherapyto help unearth any repressed memory.</p><p>I don’t think so.</p><p>Mr. Young, I can’t just medicate him indefinitely.</p><p>Forget the Freud and stick with the drugs.</p><p>No new treatments without my permission.</p><p>Great version of little red riding hood.</p><p>It is your involvementthat makes the plays here at Barcliff Academy so special.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>I would like to turn over the next part of our meetingto our parent coordinator, the amazing Maisy Gibbons.</p><p>Thank you, Miss Truesdale. Now before everyone leaves,we have new copies of the script up here.</p><p>Tilda and Frances and I went to the rehearsal yesterday,and we were a little troubled by the ending.</p><p>Killing the wolf. It sends the wrong message to our kids.</p><p>We believe that animals should onlybe euthanized as a last resort.</p><p>Do you find something amusing?</p><p>I’m sorry. I thought you were kidding.</p><p>No. Oh. Ok.</p><p>In our version, the wolf is aggressivebecause he has a thorn in his paw,and the woodsman will take out thethorn and send Mr. Wolf on his way.</p><p>I’m sorry. Aren’t we doing little red riding hood?</p><p>Yes. So then you are aware that the wolf is a bad guy.</p><p>He eats little red’s grandma.</p><p>If you let him go, he’s gonna chowdown on other defenseless old ladies.</p><p>I’m sorry. And you are?</p><p>I’m Lynette Scavo.</p><p>My twins just joined. They’re playing oak trees.</p><p>Oh, of course. Lynette.</p><p>Let’s see. You are signed up totake tickets the night of the show, is that right?</p><p>Yeah. Well, with all due respect,let’s leave the creative suggestionsto the mothers who have assumed the heavy lifting. Shall we?</p><p>Sure. Whatever.</p><p>I must say I’m jealous of howmuch time you two spend together.</p><p>My mother-in-law would never wantto hang out with me all day.</p><p>She sounds nice.</p><p>Hey there, you two.</p><p>Hi, John.</p><p>Mrs. Solis.</p><p>I wasn’t aware you two were friends.</p><p>We go to the same school. Of course you do.</p><p>Mama, if you need anything.</p><p>We’ll be upstairs in my room studying.</p><p>Have fun.</p><p>Doesn’t it make you nervous?</p><p>A boy alone upstairs with Danielle?</p><p>Oh, no. I don’t worry about John.</p><p>Both he and Danielle are in the abstinence club.</p><p>Coffee’s a little hot.</p><p>Susan was infuriated by Paul’s evasive answers.</p><p>She was convinced he was deliberately hiding Zachand hiding the truth.</p><p>She hoped that finding one would lead to the other.</p><p>To succeed, Susan would have to be evasive herself.</p><p>Susan. Long time no see. Mrs. Greenberg.</p><p>Do you remember those two eggsI let you borrow last Christmas?</p><p>I need those back. Gosh, honey, I’m fresh out.</p><p>But if you want, I could run to the store.</p><p>Oh, forget about it. It’s not that important.</p><p>But since I’m here, do you still havethat old hatchback sitting in your garage?</p><p>Can I borrow it tomorrow? You want to borrow my car?</p><p>Just for a couple of hours.</p><p>I’m not sure. Do you know how to drive a stick?</p><p>Yes, I think so. I learned in college.</p><p>It’s like riding a bike, right?</p><p>I’m not sure, dear.</p><p>It’s no big deal. It’s just for a couple of hours.</p><p>I let you borrow my eggs for a whole year.</p><p>Fist off, I’m very pleased with the work we’vedone in our sessions thus far.</p><p>We’re making excellent progress.</p><p>Thank you. I feel good about it.</p><p>But there are a few areas of yourmarriage we haven’t covered yet.</p><p>Oh, really? Like what?</p><p>I’ve told Dr. Goldfine in our private sessionsthat I’m not happy with our sex life.</p><p>And Rex feels that when the two of you have intercourse,you’re not as connected as you could be.</p><p>Connected? Yeah.</p><p>Like you’re thinking about other things.</p><p>Is your hair getting messed up?</p><p>Did you buy the toothpaste? You’re just not there.</p><p>This kind of disconnect is oftena symptom of a deeper problem.</p><p>So we were talking and the ideaof a sexual surrogate came up.</p><p>This is a licensed professionalwho’d work with you as a coupleon solving whatever sexual problems you may be having.</p><p>I have an excellent referral.</p><p>And what would this sexual surrogate person do?</p><p>She would coach us. She?</p><p>She’s very discreet. You’ll hardly notice she’s there.</p><p>Oh. So she would be in the room with uswhile we make love?</p><p>Yes. Helping us to achieve maximum sexual potential.</p><p>Do you have any questions? Just one.</p><p>How much longer is your mid-life crisis going to last?</p><p>Because it is really starting to tick me off.</p><p>Right. Everyone’s down for a nap.</p><p>We’ve got no more than an hour. Let’s get cracking.</p><p>Five-card draw. Nothing wild.</p><p>How is it going with mike, Susan?</p><p>It’s going, finally.</p><p>We have a first official date next week.</p><p>I think he’s taking me to see a play or something.</p><p>Might I suggest the Barcliff Academyproduction of little red riding hood?</p><p>Oh, that’s right. The twins’ stage debut.</p><p>Are they having fun?</p><p>Sure. They play oak trees.</p><p>I have to deal with the drama behind the scenes.</p><p>Oh, I take it you’ve met Maisy Gibbons?</p><p>She’s a total nightmare.</p><p>I guess I shouldn’t have challenged her. Oh, dear.</p><p>Because now no one on the play committee wants to talk to me.</p><p>Maisy does love to rule her little kingdom.</p><p>Hasn’t changed since girl scouts.</p><p>Girls smile at you to your faceand then behind your back, make fun of you ’causeyou’re the only one not shaving your legs yet.</p><p>That wouldn’t happen in boy scouts.</p><p>When I worked with men,I preferred the way they fought.</p><p>A guy takes his opponent on face-to-face,and once he’s won, he’s top dog.</p><p>It’s primitive but it’s fair.</p><p>And a lot less sneaky.</p><p>Isn’t it sexist of us to generalize like this?</p><p>It’s science, Gabrielle.</p><p>Sociologists have documented this stuff.</p><p>Well, who am I to argue with sociologists?</p><p>Wow, this guacamole has got a kick.</p><p>I’m gonna run to the little girl’s room.</p><p>You go ahead. I might be a while.</p><p>I hate playing three-handed poker. Let’s take a break.</p><p>I’ll play. You play poker?</p><p>I used to play with my grandfather. Pull up a chair.</p><p>You’re just playing for chips?</p><p>My grandfather used to sayit’s always more fun to play for money.</p><p>Why not? 50 cents a bet? Make it a buck.</p><p>Three raise limit, $ 20 buy-in.</p><p>Mrs. Solis! What are you doing?</p><p>Why haven’t you returned my calls?</p><p>I’ve been busy. I’ve seen who you’ve been busy with.</p><p>Danielle? Come on. She’s just a friend.</p><p>Before you get any friendlier, let me remind you,I can do things to you she can’t even pronounce.</p><p>A lot of good it does me with yourmother-in-law following you around all the time.</p><p>Maybe we should just cool it for a while.</p><p>No, John, please don’t say that.</p><p>I have everything under control.</p><p>Now give me a boost.</p><p>Hey. So what did I miss?</p><p>Not much. Just a few friendly hands of poker with the girls.</p><p>I’m sorry I’m late.</p><p>As I’m sure you’ve all heard,Celia Bond broke her wrist playing tennis.</p><p>Which means we are now in desperate needof someone to do the costumes.</p><p>I’m keeping my fingers crossed. Are there any volunteers?</p><p>I’ll do it.</p><p>Really? That’s a –Do you know how to sew?</p><p>Absolutely.</p><p>Well, great. Thank you, Lynette.</p><p>Ok. So now that I’m going to do some ”heavy lifting”,I believe I have the right to talkabout the changes made to the script?</p><p>Ladies.</p><p>We grew up with little red riding hood,and survived it, scary stuff and all.</p><p>So I say to hell with political correctness.</p><p>Let our kids experience this classiclike it was meant to be enjoyed.</p><p>Let’s kill the damn wolf and justput on the best show we can.</p><p>Thank you, Lynette, for that impassioned speech.</p><p>But I believe that ship has sailed. No! It hasn’t.</p><p>We still have time to change the ending back.</p><p>And you know, Maisy, it is just a fairy tale.</p><p>I don’t think it will upset the children.</p><p>I think you’re wrong.</p><p>That’s what’s so great about democracy.</p><p>Everyone’s entitled to their opinion.</p><p>Also, everyone has a right to vote.</p><p>So all in favor of the woodsman goingmedieval on the big bad wolf’s ass.</p><p>Dr. Goldfine.</p><p>Bree. You’re dining alone?</p><p>Actually, I am. What a coincidence. So am I.</p><p>Seems a shame for us to eat by ourselves.</p><p>Shall I pull up a chair?</p><p>Bree, it’s nothing personal,but I never socialize with clients.</p><p>Oh, I get it. I’m so sorry. Of course. It’s inappropriate.</p><p>It’s just that after what happened yesterdaythere’s so much I need to say because...</p><p>I suppose it can wait.</p><p>No, Lynette, I’m sorry. Juanita’s taking a bath.</p><p>How much did she win from you?</p><p>Jeez!</p><p>Yeah, I guess she’ll take a check.</p><p>Ok. All right. Bye.</p><p>What was that about?</p><p>Turns out your mother is quite the card shark.</p><p>You let her play cards? How long did she play?</p><p>Not that long. Why?</p><p>Carlos, what is it?</p><p>I never told you this, but my motherhad a serious gambling problem.</p><p>Was this before we were married?</p><p>Yeah. It was bad.</p><p>She went into debt. Dipped into her savings,started hocking jewelry.</p><p>Honey, it was only a small neighborhood game.</p><p>It doesn’t take much for her to fall off the wagon.</p><p>I know she seems like a very strong woman but...</p><p>She has a major weakness.</p><p>Honey... Oh... It’s ok.</p><p>You were right to tell me this.</p><p>And you understand I have to treat this as a session.</p><p>Of course. That’s fine.</p><p>Shall I include the meal?</p><p>Oh, no. We’ll split that.</p><p>Ok.</p><p>So let’s talk about yesterday.</p><p>Do you think there might havebeen some truth in what Rex said?</p><p>No, I don’t.</p><p>Bree, you know. It’s not uncommon for people experiencingsexual repression to distance themselves during the act.</p><p>Is that how you see me?</p><p>As some sort of prude who just lays there like a cold fish?</p><p>I love sex. All right.</p><p>I love everything about it. The sensations. The smells.</p><p>I especially love the feel of a man.</p><p>All that muscle and sinew pressed against my body.</p><p>And then when you add friction!</p><p>The tactile sensation of running my tongueover a man’s nipple ever so gently.</p><p>And then there’s the act itself. Two bodies becoming one,and that final eruption of pleasure.</p><p>To be honest. The only thing I don’t like about sex is the scrotum.</p><p>Obviously it has its practical applications,but I’m not a fan.</p><p>Can I get you something?</p><p>Uh... Just the check, please.</p><p>Sir, you haven’t ordered yet.</p><p>We’re not shopping?</p><p>Oh, I thought we stop you for lunch first.</p><p>This place has the best buffet in town.</p><p>All-you-can-eat crab legs.</p><p>Oh, no! What’s wrong? Let’s go.</p><p>Oh, I didn’t realize how late it was.</p><p>They are only holding the suit minute for me until two.</p><p>If we stay I’ll never make it.</p><p>We’ll just have lunch at the mall.</p><p>Wait. Uh... I’m really in the mood for crab legs.</p><p>Why don’t you just drop me off and you can come back.</p><p>Well, if the mall is crowded it might take over an hour.</p><p>It’s a buffet. There’s no rush.</p><p>Hi, John. Motel. Ten minutes. Be there.</p><p>All right. Off you go. Thanks.</p><p>Lynette, I couldn’t help noticeyou forgot the coonskin on that hunter’s coonskin cap.</p><p>Yeah. That was a creative call.</p><p>Look, I’m in the middle of a costumes crisis.</p><p>If I don’t take shortcuts I’ll never finish.</p><p>Jordana Geist manages to get her work done.</p><p>She runs the concessions, paints the sets,and still has time to take care of her three kids and a husband.</p><p>Now, we can’t have the students sufferjust because you don’t understandthe concept of time management.</p><p>I hardly think the kids are gonna sufferwithout a clump of fur on their heads.</p><p>Ok. I’ll make a creative call. We’ll cut the oak trees.</p><p>That forest is looking a little dense anyway.</p><p>My boys are the oak trees. Are they?</p><p>Well, I wouldn’t worry.</p><p>We’ll find something for them to do backstage.</p><p>That’s where the real action is.</p><p>I’ll finish the costumes. Well. Crisis averted.</p><p>You have lost your mind. I checked up on Silvercrest place.</p><p>It’s a treatment center for troubled kids.</p><p>Who is gonna notice. One more,I create the distraction, you blend in and find Zach.</p><p>How could I blend in with messed-up teenagers?</p><p>I don’t know, Julie.</p><p>You pretend to be bulimic. Gag a little.</p><p>Come on. Work with me here.</p><p>Mama, when this is over,we need to talk about your parenting skills.</p><p>Ok, fine. You don’t want to help me,I’m not gonna force you.</p><p>It’s not that I don’t want to. It’s just...</p><p>Why does this mean so much to you?</p><p>Because Mary Alice was a wonderful person.</p><p>And now all anybody thinks about her is thatshe went off the deep end and did this terrible, selfish thing.</p><p>And I think there’s more to it than that.</p><p>she was my friend, Julie,and I owe it to her to find out the truth.</p><p>Juanita, what’s wrong?</p><p>Juanita?</p><p>I didn’t go to the buffet. I went gambling instead and I lost.</p><p>How much did you have on you? It couldn’t have been much.</p><p>I used Carlos’ credit card.</p><p>Ok. How much did you charge?</p><p>I don’t know. It stopped working.</p><p>What do you mean it stopped working?</p><p>This thing has like a $ 15,000 credit limit.</p><p>The man at the desk said there were no vacant rooms.</p><p>Mind if I bunk with you?</p><p>Bree, what are you doing here?</p><p>It’s a little chilly out here.</p><p>Do you mind if we discuss this inside?</p><p>Come on in.</p><p>Sure is nice and toasty in here.</p><p>You look amazing. Thanks.</p><p>I was hoping you’d notice.</p><p>Well, it certainly isn’t the Ritz,but it has all the essentials.</p><p>I don’t know what to say.</p><p>The perhaps you should say nothing.</p><p>Rex? Baby...</p><p>I just need a minute. What?</p><p>Sweetie, just leave it, will you? Just leave it.</p><p>Ok, baby. Where were we?</p><p>I told you to leave it.</p><p>I’m sorry. I just...</p><p>Oh, come on. Are you gonna make a big deal about this?</p><p>You know? To tell you the truth.</p><p>Now is not really a good time for me.</p><p>It’s obvious you’ve never had to remove a cheese stain.</p><p>Bree, I totally understand. Yeah, I already tried Susan.</p><p>And Gaby can’t sew. Seriously, I’m gonna be fine.</p><p>Yeah. Ow! Thanks anyway. Bye-bye.</p><p>Well, I’m a little ahead with my painting.</p><p>If you need some help.</p><p>Oh, Jordana, you are a life-saver. Thank you.</p><p>Here. These pieces need trim.</p><p>I’ll help for as long as I can,but I have a lot on my plate tonight.</p><p>I have to make 25 mini Quiches for my book club.</p><p>You’re not a human, are you?</p><p>You were sent by aliens to make humans race feel inadequate.</p><p>Seriously, how do you cram it all in?</p><p>Can you keep a secret? Um... Sure.</p><p>That’s ADD medication.</p><p>Oh, my kids take this or they almost did.</p><p>I thought it was supposed to calmed you down.</p><p>Has the opposite effect if you don’t have ADD.</p><p>Ever chug a pot of Turkish coffee?</p><p>Seriously? You’re taking your kids’ medication?</p><p>Once in a while. Do you want a couple?</p><p>Oh, that’s very kind of you but I justsmoked some crack a little while ago. So.</p><p>I’d better not mix.</p><p>This is what we will do. I’ll sell some old jewelry.</p><p>Pay off the credit card, and Carlos will never find out.</p><p>You would do that for me?</p><p>Of course I would. Why wouldn’t I?</p><p>For starters, you hate me.</p><p>Oh, that is overstating it... a little.</p><p>The bottom line is, no matter how much I dislike you,I love Carlos more.</p><p>If Carlos finds out the money, he’ll be devastated.</p><p>I don’t wanna see him hurt.</p><p>You don’t have to believe I’m a good person,but at least believe I care about my husband.</p><p>Fine. To heck with it.</p><p>I’m not gonna risk my neck to protect you.</p><p>I’m calling Carlos.</p><p>Juanita might have ben the gambler of the family...</p><p>Wait. I believe you.</p><p>...but Gabrielle wasthe one who knew how to bluff.</p><p>Hi. I’m Susan Mayer.</p><p>I have an appointment to see Dr. Sicher.</p><p>Yes, he’s expecting you. Let me get him for you.</p><p>Hi. I’m Dr. Sicher. Susan Mayer.</p><p>So you’re doing research for a children’s book?</p><p>I sure am.</p><p>Zach?</p><p>Oh. Hi, Julie.</p><p>What’s wrong with you?</p><p>Just all the pills they make me take.</p><p>They kinda make me sleepy.</p><p>What are you doing here?</p><p>I came to see how you were.</p><p>And to ask you something.</p><p>Look, I don’t have much time.</p><p>What is it?</p><p>Last week you told Mrs. Van de Kampyour mom killed herselfbecause of something you did, something bad.</p><p>What were you talking about?</p><p>After my mom died, I started rememberingthings that happened when I was little.</p><p>What happened to Dana. Dana? Who’s Dana?</p><p>What are you doing here?</p><p>I was just visiting my friend.</p><p>This patient is not allowed visitors.</p><p>I guess I have to go.</p><p>I am so sorry, Zach.</p><p>I don’t want to disturb you.</p><p>I just left some important papers here.</p><p>What are you doing?</p><p>I’m repairing a chipped mug.</p><p>Why don’t you just buy a new one?</p><p>Because I think it’s better to fix what you already have.</p><p>Listen. Um...</p><p>About what happened today.</p><p>You humiliated me, Rex.</p><p>For no good reason.</p><p>I’m sorry. I was there. I was willing.</p><p>Normal men don’t say no to that.</p><p>You... You upset me.</p><p>See, I don’t think that’s the reason.</p><p>After I left the motel,I did some thinking about us and our sex life.</p><p>I realized there has been a disconnect.</p><p>But it’s coming from you. That’s ridiculous.</p><p>how many years we’ve been making loveand you’ve started to ask me somethingbut then you stopped.</p><p>I... I don’t know what you are talking about?</p><p>You are unhappy with our sex lifebecause you’re not getting something from mebut you’re simplely too afraid to ask.</p><p>My problem with our sex life is that you can’t stopthinking about the housework.</p><p>Well, if that’s the case,then take me right here, right now.</p><p>The house is spotless.</p><p>There are no burritos around to pull my focus.</p><p>I’m not in the mood. Why not?</p><p>We haven’t had sex for months, Rex.</p><p>Most normal, red-blooded menwould be climbing the walls by now.</p><p>Please don’t do this.</p><p>Rex, whatever you want.</p><p>I will go there with you. You just have to say it out loud.</p><p>Tell me. What do you want? What do you need?</p><p>I need for you to stop talking like this.</p><p>Why? Because you sound like a whore.</p><p>No, I sound like a womanwhose husband won’t touch her.</p><p>Rex, after Mary Alice killed herself,it all hit me.</p><p>We all have our secrets.</p><p>I think it’s time for you to tell me yours.</p><p>I’m going.</p><p>That night, while most of Wisteria Lanedreamt the night away,Lynette was in the middle of her own personal nightmare.</p><p>Determined her boys would not miss their fairy-tale debut,Lynette had stayed up 18 hours straight, sewing.</p><p>But she began to fear her storywould not have a happy ending.</p><p>Luckily for Lynette, she had a magic potion handy.</p><p>And once she had taken it...</p><p>The magic kept working...</p><p>And working...</p><p>And working.</p><p>It wasn’t until noon that Lynette finally took a break,and the reality of what she had done began to sink in.</p><p>My. What big eyes you have.</p><p>I’m going to the store. Do you need anything?</p><p>I’m fine, thank you.</p><p>So what’s been going on with her?</p><p>Have you found anything out yet?</p><p>Actually, Carlos, the more I watch her, the moreI think she’s probably not stepping out on you.</p><p>Really?</p><p>Yeah. She’s not perfect, Lord knows.</p><p>But she loves you. I can tell.</p><p>Mama. You don’t know what a relief it is to hear that.</p><p>You know, it’s funny. I really think she loves you, too.</p><p>Oh?</p><p>I got concerned when I heard youplayed poker with her friends.</p><p>So I told her about your little problem.</p><p>You told her about my gambling problem?</p><p>Don’t be mad, Mama. I just didn’t wantyou slipping into old habits.</p><p>And Gabrielle was very concerned about you. She knew?</p><p>I don’t get it. You and Zach never wentto school with anybody named Dana.</p><p>He didn’t say it was somebody we went to school with.</p><p>Did it sound like a relative?</p><p>He said Dana. It sounded like ”Dana”.</p><p>Unless he was using a code,that’s all I got.</p><p>Ok, give me a break here. I’m just grasping at straws.</p><p>I’m sorry. I’m worried about Zach.</p><p>It’s really creepy in there.</p><p>Can’t we get him out?</p><p>Honey, that’s up to his father.</p><p>Then I want to visit again.</p><p>That’s not a good idea either.</p><p>Why?</p><p>I just have a feeling.</p><p>Juanita was now more convinced than everthat her treacherous daughter-in-law was having an affair.</p><p>But the question remained, with whom?</p><p>And suddenly...</p><p>Juanita rememberedit wasn’t the men Gabrielle talked tothat she had to worry about.</p><p>Hey, Jordana, Maisy.</p><p>Here are the costumes. Right on time.</p><p>Thank you, Lynette.</p><p>This is a bit awkward.</p><p>There has been an oversight with the programs.</p><p>Celia Bond is still credited with costumes.</p><p>They forgot to tell the printer.</p><p>Incidentally, who is ”they”,as in, ”they forgot to tell the printer”?</p><p>That would be me. I’m sorry.</p><p>But I was so overworked this week withall the script changes you demanded.</p><p>Uh-huh. Well, these things happen.</p><p>Be right back.</p><p>Would you do something with this?</p><p>It looks like road kill.</p><p>Ok, lady, that’s it.</p><p>I beg your pardon?</p><p>We have kids the same age.</p><p>Which means there’re years ahead of ushaving to deal with each other.</p><p>So instead of playing petty games,why don’t we put an end to this right now?</p><p>What are you saying? Let’s take it outside.</p><p>Let’s take what outside?</p><p>Your sorry ass. We’re throwin’ down.</p><p>You are crazy. Just being practical.</p><p>Isn’t it better to settle this once in frawrather than endure all this Alpha-Mom crapuntil our kids graduate?</p><p>Come on.
