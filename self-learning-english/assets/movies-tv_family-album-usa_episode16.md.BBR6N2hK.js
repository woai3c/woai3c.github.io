Why don&#39;t you write to me, Robbie, so I can get some interesting mail?</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: You were right, Grandpa. Advertising, bills, bills, advertising.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Yes. It&#39;s just like I said, Robbie. Nothing interesting.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: You won&#39;t believe it, Grandpa, but there&#39;s a letter here addressed to you, Mr. Malcolm Stewart, and it looks like a personal letter.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Oh, it must be a bill.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: I don&#39;t think so. The return name and address is Pete Waters, RFD Number 1, Chesterton.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: You&#39;re joking. Pete Waters?</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Pete Waters, RFD Number 1, Chesterton. You know him?</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Do I know Pete Waters? You bet I do! He was my roommate in college. He visited with Grandma and me in Florida about five years ago.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: What does he say? Is he OK?</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Yeah, he&#39;s fine. Just fine. He&#39;s writing to invite me to spend a weekend with him at his farm. He&#39;s planning a get-together with two or three other college friends. The kind of a fifty-year anniversary reunion.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Sounds like fun. Fifty years? Wow!</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: It sounds like fun to me, too, Robbie.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: What kind of farm does he have?</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: I&#39;ve never been there, Robbie, but he has chickens and cows and all. That means fresh eggs and fresh milk.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Does he have a family?</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: No, he doesn&#39;t, Robbie. He never married. He&#39;s not as lucky as I am to have a family and grandchildren. I&#39;m a lucky man.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: How come he never got married?</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: That&#39;s a good question, Robbie. A very good question. He never married because the girl he was in love with in college married someone else. As simple as that. He never got over it.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: He must have loved her very much.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Yes. Very much. Lillian Winters. She was in our class.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: And what happened?</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: She was in love with Donald McGrath, the quarterback on our football team.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Football players are always popular with the ladies.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: She liked Pete, and they went to dances together. But her heart was with Donald.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Did he ever get over it?</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: No, he never did.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Where is she today?</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: I don&#39;t know. Maybe Lillian will be at the reunion.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: You think so?</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Pete&#39;s full of surprises.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: I wish I could go there with you, Grandpa. What do you think the surprise will be?</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: With Pete, you never know, Robbie.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Won&#39;t it be exciting to see all your college friends there again?</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: It is already. I&#39;m kind of excited about going now. Next weekend... sleep over Friday and Saturday night and come back Sunday. I can&#39;t wait!</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Don&#39;t you think you ought to call Pete and tell him you&#39;re coming?</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: You&#39;re reading my mind, Robbie.</p><h2 id="act-2" tabindex="-1">Act 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#act-2" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Act 2&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Attendant</strong>: Hello. What can I do for you?</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Hi. Fill&#39;er up. I need a full tank.</p><p><strong>Attendant</strong>: Check the hood?</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: No, thanks.</p><p><strong>Attendant</strong>: Whereabouts are you headed?</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Pete Waters&#39;s farm, near Chesterton.</p><p><strong>Attendant</strong>: I know it well. Pete Waters has lived around here almost as long as I have.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: How long is it going to take for me to get there?</p><p><strong>Attendant</strong>: About fifteen minutes. There&#39;s a shortcut—if you know it.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: No, I don&#39;t. Could you tell me how to use the shortcut?</p><p><strong>Attendant</strong>: Sure. You take the next left turn. You&#39;ll see a stop sign. Make a right at the stop sign. Stay on that road, and you&#39;ll cross a blue bridge. Then you&#39;ll see a big old red barn. That&#39;s the back of Pete Waters&#39;s place.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: That&#39;s quite a difference from the directions that Pete sent me.</p><p><strong>Attendant</strong>: Now, if you take that route, it&#39;s probably a lot simpler, but it&#39;ll take you ten minutes longer.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: OK. Let me repeat it. I take the next left turn to the stop sign. Then a right across a blue bridge, and then a big red barn.</p><p><strong>Attendant</strong>: Can&#39;t miss it.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: How much do I owe you?</p><p><strong>Attendant</strong>: Well, that&#39;ll be eighteen dollars and seventy cents. No charge for the cleanup. It&#39;s on the house.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Well, here&#39;s a twenty.</p><p><strong>Attendant</strong>: Ah. OK. That&#39;s a dollar and thirty cents change. There we go... will make twenty. Thanks.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Thank you. And thanks for the directions.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: This must be Pete&#39;s barn. Turn right to the house. Hi.</p><p><strong>Worker</strong>: Hi. What can I do for you?</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Is this the Pete Waters farm?</p><p><strong>Worker</strong>: It is.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: I&#39;m a friend of Pete&#39;s. I&#39;m looking for the house.</p><p><strong>Worker</strong>: It&#39;s just over yonder. Keep along this road till you get to the end of the fence. You&#39;ll see the chickens. His house is on the left.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Well, thanks.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: &quot;Have gone to the railroad station. Back soon with a surprise. Make yourself at home. Have a look around. Pete.&quot; Same old Pete Waters. Always full of surprises.</p><h2 id="act-3" tabindex="-1">Act 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#act-3" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Act 3&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Arnold</strong>: Don&#39;t tell me. Please don&#39;t tell me. I recognize you...</p><p><strong>Peggy</strong>: Oh, don&#39;t be silly, Arnie. Of course you recognize him. Except for the beard, he hasn&#39;t changed in fifty years. It&#39;s Malcolm Stewart!</p><p><strong>Arnold</strong>: I know it&#39;s Malcolm Stewart. You haven&#39;t changed much in fifty years.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Peggy—Peggy Pendleton! You&#39;re Peggy Pendleton!</p><p><strong>Arnold</strong>: Who am I, you old rascal? You don&#39;t recognize me, do you?</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: I know who you are. You&#39;re Arnold Franklin! I know who you are!</p><p><strong>Peggy</strong>: You look wonderful, Malcolm!</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Sit down. Pete isn&#39;t home.</p><p><strong>Arnold</strong>: Really?</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: No. He left a note on the door saying he was going to the railroad station to pick up a surprise.</p><p><strong>Peggy</strong>: He&#39;s so funny. Always full of surprises, even fifty years later.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: The two of you look unbelievable!</p><p><strong>Arnold</strong>: How&#39;s your family? Oh, I was sorry to hear about your wife having passed away.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Yes. About four years ago.</p><p><strong>Peggy</strong>: And you&#39;re living with your children now? In New York? Pete wrote us and told us.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Yup. Retired and moved to New York to live with my son and his family.</p><p><strong>Peggy</strong>: By the way, what do you think this big surprise is?</p><p><strong>Arnold</strong>: It could be most anything, knowing Pete.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Hey, that must be Pete! Now we&#39;ll find out about the surprise.</p><p><strong>Pete</strong>: So good to see you all!</p><p><strong>Peggy</strong>: Oh, Pete, Pete! Oh, it&#39;s so good to see you!</p><p><strong>Pete</strong>: Remember Lillian?</p><p><strong>Lillian</strong>: I remember all of you. You haven&#39;t changed a bit.</p><p><strong>Peggy</strong>: Lillian! Oh, my gosh!</p><p><strong>Arnold</strong>: Lillian Winters. We were together in the Thursday night drama society.</p><p><strong>Lillian</strong>: Remember me, Malcolm?</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Oh, beautiful as ever, Lillian. How&#39;s Donald?</p><p><strong>Lillian</strong>: That&#39;s OK, Malcolm. Donald passed away a couple of years ago.</p><p><strong>Arnold</strong>: Sorry to hear that, Lillian.</p><p><strong>Peggy</strong>: Oh, I&#39;m so sorry.</p><p><strong>Arnold</strong>: I would not have missed this get-together for the world!</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: And your little surprise, Pete? You really surprised me by having us all come together.</p><p><strong>Pete</strong>: You don&#39;t know what the surprise is yet? Come on! We&#39;ll tell you the big surprise.</p><p><strong>Pete</strong>: I&#39;ve invited you here for the weekend to help celebrate.</p><p><strong>Peggy</strong>: Celebrate?</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Our fiftieth reunion?</p><p><strong>Arnold</strong>: No.</p><p><strong>Lillian</strong>: No. Pete wants to tell you...</p><p><strong>Pete</strong>: Now, let me have the honor, Lillian.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: For goodness sake, Pete, tell us! I can&#39;t wait much longer.</p><p><strong>Pete</strong>: Well, I am pouring this iced tea so that we can toast Lillian—and me.</p><p><strong>Peggy</strong>: You don&#39;t mean to tell me that you and...</p><p><strong>Pete</strong>: Yes, I do. I have loved Lillian all these years, so I asked her to be Mrs. Pete Waters.</p><p><strong>Lillian</strong>: And I said yes.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: I knew it! Congratulations!</p><p><strong>Peggy</strong>: Oh, Lillian, I am so happy for you both.</p><p><strong>Arnold</strong>: It&#39;s wonderful!</p><p><strong>Pete</strong>: It&#39;s wonderful for me. Lillian will make me a happy man finally.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: You are full of surprises, Pete.</p><p><strong>Pete</strong>: We are going to spend the entire weekend having a good time together here on the farm. We are going to celebrate all weekend.</p><p><strong>Peggy</strong>: When is the wedding?</p><p><strong>Pete</strong>: That&#39;s another surprise. Lillian and I were married two weeks ago in Detroit. She&#39;s come here to stay.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Wait till I tell my family about this!</p><p><strong>Peggy</strong>: Why, that&#39;s wonderful!</p>',124),a=[s];function g(i,p,l,d,h,u){return o(),t("div",null,a)}const b=e(r,[["render",g]]);export{y as __pageData,b as default};
