I love it.</p><p>Well, this is the nicest present you boys have ever given me.</p><p>And you know what? I’m going to put it out on the front porch the whole neighborhood can enjoy it.</p><p>Lynette knew she’d cherish the memory of that moment for the rest of her life.</p><p>The memory of that moment was ruined the very next day.</p><p>Mrs. Mccluskey, why are you taking my flower pot?</p><p>Because it’s mine.</p><p>Your boys stole it off my porch.</p><p>No, no, no. My sons made that for me for Valentine’s Day!</p><p>I bought this in Costa Rica on my last cruise. You see?</p><p>It’s still got the price tag on it. Look.</p><p>What? Nothing more to say? Cat got your tongue?</p><p>You listen to me, keep your brats off my property.</p><p>Yes, most mothers will tell you their children are a gift from god.</p><p>Most mothers will also tell you there are some days when you wish you could return them.</p><p>It was the day before Valentine’s Day and every man on Wisteria Lane was preparing for this most dangerous of holidays.</p><p>While some purchased romantic cards...</p><p>...and some brought home candy and flowers...</p><p>and some made dinner reservations at fancy restaurants...</p><p>...others managed to forget about the day entirely... again.</p><p>This flurry of activity was lost on the women of Wisteria Lane.</p><p>They were busy learning a secret about their neighbors.</p><p>A secret that was positively heartbreaking.</p><p>So Paul said that Zachary killed Dana?</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>Well, it must have been an accident.</p><p>I mean, little boys don’t just kill their baby sisters Well, whatever it was, that boy is seriously disturbed, and I’ve forbidden Julie from hanging out with him.</p><p>Could you hold her?</p><p>So this is it.</p><p>This is the secret that Mary Alice was trying to protect.</p><p>Think of the guilt that she must have lived with.</p><p>You know, I never thought I’d say this, but I kind of feel sorry for Paul.</p><p>I wish I could. I still feel like something’s not right.</p><p>- What do you mean? - Well, we’ve all been in their house.</p><p>Have you ever seen a picture of another kid there?</p><p>I mean, why keep Dana’s baby blanket and throw out all the photos?</p><p>That’s a good point.</p><p>We never answered why did Mary Alice refer to herself as ”Angela” in that therapy session?</p><p>All I know is this – Mary Alice loved Zach more than anything in the world.</p><p>When you love a child that much...</p><p>you’re capable of doing all sorts of things.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>Hello? These were delivered to my house by mistake. May I?</p><p>They’re for Mary Alice Young.</p><p>Oh, my god.</p><p>I, uh... had a standing order with the florist.</p><p>I... forgot to cancel it.</p><p>Mary Alice was my wife.</p><p>She passed away a few months ago.</p><p>I’m very sorry for your loss.</p><p>And I’m sorry for yours.</p><p>- Pardon? - Your sister? Martha?</p><p>Oh... Yes... Her.</p><p>Good lord, that’s Angela.</p><p>What?</p><p>Angela Forrest. We worked together in Utah.</p><p>It must be 15 years ago.</p><p>I’m afraid you’re mistaken. My wife’s name was Mary Alice.</p><p>She’s... never been to Utah.</p><p>Well, I could be mistaken.</p><p>As I said, it’s... it’s been years.</p><p>No, Mickey, you’re wrong. I wasn’t acting like a diva.</p><p>I left the boat show because that coordinator was making passes at me.</p><p>I mean, it’s not my fault. Yao Lin, you missed a spot.</p><p>No, spare me the lecture and just book me another job, quick.</p><p>Carlos and I are up to our asses in bills and we can’t pay ’em.</p><p>Fine. Bye.</p><p>- What did you say? - Nothing.</p><p>Are you going to clean that spot?</p><p>- Which one? - The one I told you to clean.</p><p>I’ll get to it.</p><p>Clean it now.</p><p>- Why? - Because I said so.</p><p>Ok. But you got to say please.</p><p>Fine. Please.</p><p>Anything to get you back on your knees scrubbing where you belong.</p><p>- You’re not better than me. - Excuse me?</p><p>The only reason you have anything in your life is because you’re pretty.</p><p>One day you’ll be old and when that happens, you’ll be nothing.</p><p>You are so fired.</p><p>No kidding.</p><p>Ooh, Valentine’s Day card. It’s pretty.</p><p>And meticulously hand-painted.</p><p>Whoever sent you that must really love you.</p><p>- And be loaded with talent. - It’s beautiful. Thanks.</p><p>So are we still on for tomorrow night?</p><p>Oh, not only are we on, I got reservations at Le Petit Fleur.</p><p>Ooh, that place is so pretentious.</p><p>I’ve been dying to go there.</p><p>Boys? Get your little fannies inside.</p><p>Guys?</p><p>Oh, poor, Lynette. If she doesn’t get a new nanny soon, - She’s gonna implode. - Shh.</p><p>Hey, guys. Who you hiding from?</p><p>- Our mom. - She wants to spank us.</p><p>Why, did you do something bad?</p><p>Well, if you hide out too long, she’ll get worried.</p><p>Then she’ll get madder.</p><p>You know what I say? Go on home. Take your lumps.</p><p>There’s a decent chance you’ll have the rest of day to play.</p><p>Come on, climb aboard.</p><p>- Pretty impressive. - Well, I love kids.</p><p>Can’t wait to have my own some day.</p><p>We don’t want to get spanked.</p><p>Yeah, we promise we’ll be good.</p><p>Too late. You stole. And then you lied.</p><p>Even worse, you made me look bad in front of Mrs. Mccluskey, who you know is mommy’s sworn enemy.</p><p>Time to pick your poison.</p><p>How about a belt? It’s a classic.</p><p>Well, we could go with the old hickory stick.</p><p>It’s a clich but it’s pretty effective.</p><p>I know. We’ll go with the spatula.</p><p>The holes give it less wind resistance.</p><p>Moves faster.</p><p>No! No, no, no, no.</p><p>Guys! Hey, my hands are tied.</p><p>Thieves get spanked.</p><p>Just the way it works.</p><p>- Unless... - Unless what?</p><p>For a first time offence, if you swear, cross your heart, that you will never, never steal again, and you write Mrs. Mccluskey a letter of apology, I will let it slide.</p><p>- Ok! - Yeah! We swear.</p><p>All right, start with ”Dear Mrs. Mccluskey...” Mommy? Why are you smiling?</p><p>Do you know what ”psychological warfare” means?</p><p>- No. - Well, too bad for you.</p><p>Ok, start with a big ”m”, ”c”...</p><p>Good.</p><p>Rex and I are hosting a dinner party for ten next week.</p><p>We’re using our best china and serving duck.</p><p>So, you and Rex are a couple again?</p><p>Yes. You know, that’s one of things I hated most about our separation, not being able to throw dinner parties.</p><p>There’s just something so civilized and elegant about them, don’t you think?</p><p>I take it you’ve resolved your feelings about his infidelity?</p><p>Let’s just say I’ve put them in an imaginary box and don’t plan on looking at them for a while.</p><p>Do you think that it is the healthiest way to achieve a reconciliation?</p><p>Well, it won’t be easy at first.</p><p>There’ll be a lot of forced smiles and perfunctory love-making, but after a few decades whiz by, I’m sure I’ll find a way to forgive him.</p><p>Well, as long as you have a plan.</p><p>I do want to forgive him, Dr. Goldfine.</p><p>but... there’s something he’s still not telling me.</p><p>Really?</p><p>I think it has something to do with why he had the affair.</p><p>- Have you confronted him? - Once.</p><p>You should have seen the look in his eyes.</p><p>He was terrified I’d figure it out.</p><p>You know what it is, don’t you?</p><p>Bree, I can’t discuss other patients.</p><p>I realize that.</p><p>This thing that he’s hiding... Is it bad?</p><p>Oh, ok, um... Uh...</p><p>Maybe it’s better that I don’t know.</p><p>Bree, how does this reconciliation have a chance if the two of you can’t be honest about the innermost parts of your lives?</p><p>We’re, um... W.A.S.P. S, Dr. Goldfine.</p><p>Not acknowledging the elephant in the room is what we do best.</p><p>You’d settle for that?</p><p>A life filled with repression and denial?</p><p>And the dinner parties. Don’t forget the dinner parties.</p><p>And, uh, over there you got your Queens and, uh...</p><p>your Quad spring series, and your Deluxe 1000s, all the way to the imperial paradise. Sweet racket, huh?</p><p>I swear sometimes I wake up in the morning and I can’t believe I’m the Siesta king.</p><p>Except for how I am.</p><p>Very impressive.</p><p>So, where does the photographer want me for the shoot?</p><p>Uh, didn’t your agent tell you? There’s no shoot.</p><p>Well, then what did you hire me for?</p><p>You’ve heard the expression ”sex sells”?</p><p>That’s why you are coming.</p><p>You’re here to remind people there’s a lot of fun things they can do on a Siesta King mattress that don’t involve sleep. Get it?</p><p>It is often said that good fences make good neighbors.</p><p>But as Lynette was about to discover, the fence might just need a little barbed wire if the neighbor is Mrs. Mccluskey.</p><p>What do you think you are doing? Get out of here.</p><p>Your little criminals snuck into my house and stole my wall clock.</p><p>What?</p><p>It was a hand-painted, purple and white wall clock.</p><p>My son made it.</p><p>You sure you didn’t misplace it? You are getting up in years.</p><p>No offence, but you probably forget where you put things.</p><p>No offence, but you should be sterilized.</p><p>Look! My boys do not break into people’s houses.</p><p>Sure, they may have stolen your flowerpot.</p><p>But you know they apologized for that.</p><p>They wrote a note.</p><p>That’s the coward’s way out.</p><p>They should come over and apologize in person.</p><p>You know what? This has been fun. But now...</p><p>You let those boys run wild.</p><p>Toys all over the yard, bikes out in the street.</p><p>It’s a disgrace.</p><p>Get out of my house!</p><p>Those boys would’ve been better off raised by wolves.</p><p>God knows they would have been cleaner.</p><p>Valentine’s Day is tomorrow.</p><p>I know. I already bought your gifts.</p><p>Roses and English toffee?</p><p>Mm-hm. Just like always.</p><p>Yes. And I suppose we’ll make love tomorrow night, too.</p><p>That is our little tradition.</p><p>Good. I’m looking forward to it.</p><p>Are you looking forward to it?</p><p>What?</p><p>Well, just that I know that I don’t...</p><p>Please you sexually, so I was wondering if you really were looking forward to being with me.</p><p>Oh, for god’s sake.</p><p>I’m sorry. Rex.</p><p>I thought I could pretend that this doesn’t upset me anymore.</p><p>- But I can’t. - Please, don’t do this.</p><p>You had an affair, you went to another woman for sex to give you something I couldn’t.</p><p>At least tell me what that something is.</p><p>- Bree, I can’t. - Why not?</p><p>Rex, please tell me.</p><p>Let me prove to you how much I love you.</p><p>I like to be dominated.</p><p>Huh?</p><p>Sexually.</p><p>- Huh? - Never mind.</p><p>Rex, please, I want to understand.</p><p>Mistress, no.</p><p>- Quiet, slave. - Yes, mistress.</p><p>- Turn your head. Don’t look at me. - Mistress...</p><p>On your knees, now. Right now. Tighten your cuff.</p><p>- Yes, mistress. - Do it now. Head down.</p><p>Ow, yes, ow. Yes.</p><p>Put it in your mouth.</p><p>Yes, mistress, yes Well?</p><p>- What the hell did your mother do to you? - What?</p><p>This just reeks of unresolved childhood trauma.</p><p>It has nothing to do with my mother.</p><p>Bree, this is a preference.</p><p>It’s a perversion.</p><p>For god’s sake. You promised to be supportive.</p><p>What do you want me to say?</p><p>My husband wears metal clamps around his nipples, hooray?</p><p>I want you to try it. Just... just once.</p><p>Try what? Hurting you? You actually want me to hurt you?</p><p>So, I can feel pleasure, yes.</p><p>Fine.</p><p>So, was it good for you, too?</p><p>Mike wants babies.</p><p>- What? - He wants to have kids.</p><p>He had that look men get that says, ”I’m ready to procreate, point me to the nearest cervix”.</p><p>And this is a problem?</p><p>Oh, I can’t have another baby.</p><p>I’m so grateful I had you, I don’t regret a minute of that.</p><p>But I... found it to be completely overwhelming.</p><p>Sometimes I even wonder how I got through it.</p><p>You and me both.</p><p>So, have you told Mike how you feel?</p><p>Oh, I can’t tell him. This could be a deal-breaker.</p><p>Julie, I really love him. I don’t want to lose him.</p><p>Maybe you’re overreacting.</p><p>I bet he’d rather have you than a baby.</p><p>What if he doesn’t?</p><p>Then that’s something you need to know.</p><p>Susan shouldn’t have been so worried.</p><p>Children were the last thing on Mike’s mind.</p><p>He was too busy searching for answers in all the wrong places.</p><p>Please, just...</p><p>You got lucky. Didn’t hit anything major.</p><p>Noah’s getting impatient.</p><p>You can tell Noah I’m getting closer.</p><p>- That’s her, isn’t it? - Yeah.</p><p>Hard to believe a kid from such a good family could get so messed up.</p><p>I met somebody who recognized her photo.</p><p>Thinks she rented a room on Pine Avenue.</p><p>I was checking out houses when...</p><p>Hey, Mike, it’s me. Are you there? Pick up. Hello?</p><p>Ok, I know you’re home. Your lights are on.</p><p>Look, I really need to talk to you about something.</p><p>You know what? I’ll just gonna stop by.</p><p>I’m here. Ow!</p><p>- Are you ok? - Yeah.</p><p>Yeah, I just, uh... stubbed my toe.</p><p>So, can I come over?</p><p>I really need to talk to you about something.</p><p>Actually I got a buddy over here right now, um...</p><p>Can you wait till dinner tomorrow?</p><p>It’s... kind of important.</p><p>Um... Yeah, I guess I can wait.</p><p>- Ok, see you at seven? - I’m counting the minutes.</p><p>You should take it easy for the next few days.</p><p>I can’t cancel.</p><p>The last thing I need is for her to get suspicious.</p><p>Maybe it’s my dementia, but I still haven’t found my purple wall clock.</p><p>Nobody in my family knows or cares where your stupid clock is.</p><p>And by the way, would you tell your little criminals to get their bikes out of the street.</p><p>- Oh, I’ll get it. - No. Don’t you dare.</p><p>We’ll move it when you say please.</p><p>Please.</p><p>Ok, Ly... Ly... Lynette... Let’s not get crazy.</p><p>Even though it was Mrs. Mccluskey who had officially declared war, it was Lynette who decided to deliver the opening salvo.</p><p>- You’ll clean that up! - Think so?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Yes, the war of Wisteria Lane would indeed prove to be messy for everyone involved.</p><p>Pardon me? Pardon me?</p><p>We were wondering what the coil count is on this one.</p><p>Oh. Sorry.</p><p>What is this?</p><p>People keep coming and talking to me, asking me questions.</p><p>That is not my job.</p><p>Well, you don’t have to be rude.</p><p>I am not a mattress salesperson.</p><p>Is there something wrong with being a mattress salesperson?</p><p>Is it beneath you or something?</p><p>Honestly? Yes. I’m a model.</p><p>You know what, your agent warned me that you were a diva.</p><p>And he was right.</p><p>You won’t talk to the customers, you bitch about coffee, and you wouldn’t even chip in for Hazel’s birthday cake.</p><p>I just met the woman today.</p><p>That didn’t stop you from having a piece.</p><p>I’m sorry.</p><p>But I don’t want someone around my store that’s not a team player.</p><p>- Oh, no. Wait. - You’re fired, princess.</p><p>No...</p><p>I need to know if my policy covers it.</p><p>No, my car actually wasn’t involved.</p><p>It was my neighbor’s car... but the egg was mine.</p><p>Aha. Well, can I speak to your supervisor?</p><p>Honey? Can you come out here?</p><p>What?</p><p>Look what I found stashed in the boys’ playhouse.</p><p>Please tell me that’s not a purple wall clock.</p><p>Pack your bags, we’re moving.</p><p>Discouraged over losing her job, Gabrielle decided a makeover would be the perfect cure for her depression.</p><p>It was after finding a moisturizer she couldn’t afford that it finally occurred to Gabrielle...</p><p>...perhaps it was her pride that needed a makeover.</p><p>Excuse me, Miss?</p><p>You forgot to give me my receipt.</p><p>Oh. Right. Uh, oh... here.</p><p>Here we go. Thank you. Come again.</p><p>Mrs. Solis?</p><p>Oh, god...</p><p>Hello.</p><p>Hello, Yao Lin.</p><p>- How are you? - Good. Very good.</p><p>I wanted to call you.</p><p>I felt terrible about how we left things.</p><p>- I need lipstick. - Ok, but...</p><p>Now.</p><p>You must be loving this. Huh?</p><p>Having me serve you must be a dream come true.</p><p>Can’t complain.</p><p>That’s the difference between you and me, Yao Lin, our dreams.</p><p>Close your eyes, please.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>You see, I dreamed of pulling myself up from nothing, and I did.</p><p>I dreamed about things I wanted, and I got them all.</p><p>A high powered career, a handsome husband, an extravagant house.</p><p>So this is just a blip on the radar for me.</p><p>Because now I know what I’m capable of.</p><p>And if I did it once, I can do it again.</p><p>I’m never really down, Yao Lin.</p><p>Even when it looks like I am.</p><p>So, enjoy this moment, enjoy your dream.</p><p>’cause for you, it doesn’t get any better than this.</p><p>There. Don’t you look beautiful?</p><p>Right this way.</p><p>- Everything ok? - This dress is just riding up.</p><p>If I walk any faster, it’ll be happy Valentine’s Day for everyone.</p><p>Especially me.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Excuse me, Miss?</p><p>I’m so sorry! Is... is everyone ok?</p><p>Oh, thank you. Thank you so much.</p><p>- Oh, ma’am, your napkin. - Don’t even think about it.</p><p>Oh... It’s so wonderful, what you wrote. Thank you.</p><p>Ok, I’m not gonna be any type of company until I get something off of my chest.</p><p>Do you remember the other day when you said that you wanted to have kids?</p><p>Here’s the thing.</p><p>I don’t think I’m ready to have another baby.</p><p>I think we need to have a serious conversation.</p><p>Uh... sure.</p><p>- I’m not going over there. - Yes, you are.</p><p>No. I can deal with the humiliation of boring around returning everything the boys stole, but please, don’t make me apologize to that woman.</p><p>This is being a good neighbor.</p><p>Finding ways of getting along instead of, you know, hurling an egg at them.</p><p>Why don’t I have to apologize?</p><p>Why don’t we just go, ”Now we’re even”, and start from scratch?</p><p>If the ”pleasant human being” argument doesn’t fly, we’ll try self-preservation.</p><p>What if she wakes up, the house is on fire.</p><p>You don’t want her to call 911?</p><p>If our house catches fire, I guarantee she’s the one that started it.</p><p>Ok, my point is, the day will come when we need her help.</p><p>And I don’t want her not to help us just because of some silly feud.</p><p>- Fine. I’ll do it. - Wow. Thank you.</p><p>You know, whomever came up with model ”love thy neighbor” clearly live nowhere near Karen Mccluskey.</p><p>Yes, well, on Valentine’s Day, the only motto that really matters is, you know, ”love thy husband”.</p><p>Really? I recall no such motto.</p><p>I understand why you would want to have kids, but that chapter in my life is just closed.</p><p>I don’t think I can go back there.</p><p>And so, you know, given the way I feel and given the way I think you feel...</p><p>Oh, god. You’re not taking this well.</p><p>Well. Oh, I was afraid of this.</p><p>What?</p><p>I gotta go.</p><p>What?</p><p>I’m sorry.</p><p>I don’t believe this. You’re leaving without even trying to talk me into having your baby?</p><p>I mean. How do you know I wouldn’t cave?</p><p>I always cave. I...</p><p>Mike?</p><p>- Good night. - Night.</p><p>So, how does this... domination thing work?</p><p>So there’s nothing to be afraid of.</p><p>Mostly, we’ll just be constructing simple scenarios and acting them out.</p><p>So, it’s like we’re in a little play.</p><p>Sort of.</p><p>And if things get too rough, we’ll have a control word.</p><p>If one of us says it, the other backs off immediately.</p><p>Ok. So what’s our control word?</p><p>Well, lately I’ve been using ”Philadelphia”.</p><p>What’s wrong?</p><p>It’s that my Aunt Fern lives in philadelphia.</p><p>I don’t want to think about her, while I’m spanking you with a leather strap.</p><p>Ok. Fine. You pick a control word.</p><p>Um... How about ”Boise”?</p><p>- ”Boise”? - What’s the matter with ”Boise”?</p><p>We’re gonna be doing psychological role-playing here, Bree, and a funny word like ”Boise” will ruin the mood.</p><p>We need something that sounds serious.</p><p>Hm. How about ”Palestine”?</p><p>”Boise” will be just fine.</p><p>So, I guess we should, uh... get started.</p><p>What do you want me to do?</p><p>Handcuff me to the bed.</p><p>Bree, you are not gonna regret taking this journey with me.</p><p>This is gonna infuse our marriage with more passion than you can imagine.</p><p>You just have to trust me.</p><p>I do.</p><p>Would you mind if I ran these through the dishwasher once?</p><p>Sure.</p><p>You can wait here.</p><p>You can see him as soon as the doctor’s finished.</p><p>Oh, ok. Thanks.</p><p>Can you believe that story?</p><p>Please. There is no way that gunshot wound was self-inflicted.</p><p>And he can’t remember who stitched him up.</p><p>Well, the police are on their way to talk to him.</p><p>Let them sort it out.</p><p>Sorry about ruining dinner.</p><p>Oh, please, I’m just glad you’re ok.</p><p>So, you shot yourself?</p><p>Pretty lame, huh?</p><p>Yeah, I was cleaning my automatic and was too embarrassed to tell you.</p><p>Well, I could see why you would be.</p><p>I know it sounds crazy, I just...</p><p>I couldn’t let myself ruin your Valentine’s Day.</p><p>But I heard what you said at the restaurant.</p><p>About not wanting kids.</p><p>We don’t have to talk about that right now.</p><p>No, Susan.</p><p>I just want to be with you above everything else.</p><p>If that means not being a dad...</p><p>I may be stupid enough to shoot myself, but I’m not stupid enough to walk away from you.</p><p>You know that, right?</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>I’m gonna go outside and let you rest for a while.</p><p>Thanks... for being so understanding.</p><p>Ma’am.</p><p>Mr. Delfino?</p><p>I’m officer Russell, this is officer Walters.</p><p>Uh, we’d like to ask you a few questions.</p><p>What do you want?</p><p>The boys have something they’d like to say to you.</p><p>I have some tea heating on the stove.</p><p>Perhaps you’d better come inside, boys.</p><p>What about you, Lynette? Do you have anything to say?</p><p>No. I’ll just wait out here.</p><p>Suit yourself.</p><p>You boys want some peanut brittle?</p><p>Go ahead.</p><p>Don’t get any crumbs on my floor. Move over.</p><p>Ok, go ahead. Make with the apology.</p><p>We’re sorry.</p><p>That’s it, huh? Didn’t you know stealing is wrong?</p><p>- How old are you anyway? - We’re six.</p><p>- And how old are you? - Five.</p><p>Boy, your mother just pops them out, doesn’t she?</p><p>How old are you?</p><p>- How old do you think? - 150.</p><p>Hurry up and eat your peanut brittle.</p><p>Who’s that?</p><p>That’s my little boy.</p><p>Where does he live?</p><p>- He died when he was 12. - How come?</p><p>He got sick.
