Hurry up! Let’s go!</p><p>Where are the rest of my clothes?</p><p>I’ll find them. Just get out.</p><p>Where?</p><p>Out the window. What?</p><p>Go, go, go, go, go!</p><p>Hi, honey. You’re home early.</p><p>My meeting got canceled.</p><p>Didn’t you take a shower this morning?</p><p>I, uh, I just finished a workout.</p><p>Where’s John?</p><p>John?</p><p>Yeah. That’s his truck out front.</p><p>Gabrielle was panicked.</p><p>She knew if her husband discovered her secret,she would feel the full force of his wrath.</p><p>Hey, Mr. Solis.</p><p>Hey, John, take care of that ficus yet?</p><p>I’ll get to it as soon as I’m done here. All right.</p><p>But she was quickly reminded that...</p><p>What Carlos couldn’t see...</p><p>Yeah, sure. No problem.</p><p>couldn’t hurt her.</p><p>The peaceful facade of Wisteria Lane had recently been shattered,first by my suicide...</p><p>and then by the discovery of a note among my belongingsthat suggested a suspicious reason for my desperate act.</p><p>My friends gathered to discuss its implications.</p><p>I think we should give it to Paul.</p><p>He’s still mourning, Susan.</p><p>He’ll probably freak out.</p><p>It doesn’t matter. She was his wife.</p><p>He deserves to have all the facts.</p><p>Well, we could do it gently.</p><p>We could tell him about it over coffee and pastry.</p><p>That would be fun.</p><p>”Paul, we have proof your wife killed herselfover some deep, dark secret.</p><p>Another bear claw?”We could always call the police.</p><p>Maybe it’s just some sort of sick joke.</p><p>Well, if it was a joke, it was in very poor taste.</p><p>No, this was serious. I know it was.</p><p>We got to find out what was going on.</p><p>Let’s say we do.</p><p>There’s a chance we’re not going to like what we find.</p><p>Well, isn’t it worse to be in the dark?</p><p>I mean, imagining she did all these horrible things.</p><p>It’s the age-old question, isn’t it?</p><p>How much do we really want to know about our neighbors?</p><p>My friends were right to be concerned.</p><p>They knew that every family has its secrets,and as my son and husband could have told them,you need to think carefully before digging them up.</p><p>After talking for hours,my friends still hadn’t agreed onwhat to do with the note.</p><p>So they decided to talk about it in the morningafter a good night’s rest.</p><p>But no one could fall sleep that night.</p><p>They each kept thinking of my suicideand how terribly alone I must have felt.</p><p>You see, loneliness was somethingmy friends understood all too well.</p><p>It’s okay. I’m up.</p><p>Good.</p><p>I have a question for you.</p><p>OK.</p><p>Do you remember when you proposed?</p><p>For god’s sake –We sat on Skyline Drive and drank a bottle of apple wine,and when we finished it, you turned to me, and you said,”if you marry me, Bree Mason,I promise to love you for the rest of my life.”And even though I was engaged to Ty Grant,and even though my father didn’t like you,I said yes.</p><p>That was a long time ago.</p><p>You’re going to cancel the meeting with that divorce lawyer,and we’re going to find ourselves a marriage counselor.</p><p>Bree... You promised.</p><p>All right.</p><p>Good. I’m going to go, uh, make myself some warm milk.</p><p>Would you like something to drink?</p><p>Anything but apple wine.</p><p>Susan awoke that night alone and parched,but as she gazed out her window,she saw the tall drink of water she needed to quinch her thirst.</p><p>”Dear diary, Mike doesn’t even know I’m alive.”Shut up.</p><p>If you want to date him, you’re going to have to ask him out.</p><p>I keep hoping he’ll ask me out.</p><p>How’s that going?</p><p>Shouldn’t you be making browniesfor your nerdy friends?</p><p>I can’t find the measuring cup. Have you seen it?</p><p>The measuring cup?</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>I – well, it’s – it’s got to be here somewhere.</p><p>Just keep looking.</p><p>I know you’re awake.</p><p>I know you’re a jerk.</p><p>Dinner with Tanaka ran long. I’m sorry.</p><p>You know, Carlos, I didn’t marry youso I could have dinner by myself six times a week.</p><p>You know how bored I was today?</p><p>I came this close to actually cleaning the house.</p><p>Don’t be that way. I got you a gift.</p><p>Nope. No, no, no, no.</p><p>You’re not going to buy your way out of this one.</p><p>It’s a good gift.</p><p>Is that white gold?</p><p>Yeah. Put it on...</p><p>and then make love to me.</p><p>I’m not in the mood.</p><p>But we could stay up and talk.</p><p>When a man buys a woman expensive jewelry,there are many things he may want in return, for future reference,conversation ain’t one of them.</p><p>Hey, that was a joke. Yeah, right.</p><p>What the hell is wrong with you? Let go of me.</p><p>Hey, you’ve been acting like a nightmare for a month. What’s wrong?</p><p>I can’t fix it unless you tell me.</p><p>It’s not exciting anymore, Carlos.</p><p>So what am I supposed to do?</p><p>I don’t know.</p><p>Be the way you used to be.</p><p>Surprise me. Take my breath away.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>-Hey, Susan. Mike.</p><p>What’s wrong?</p><p>I didn’t realize anybody was going to be out here.</p><p>I just sort of rolled out of bed.</p><p>I’m sure you look fine.</p><p>Oh, Bongo, stop.</p><p>Sorry, uh... he scares easy.</p><p>No, it– it’s fine. I-I get it.</p><p>I didn’t mean to disturb you.</p><p>I’ll see you later.</p><p>Do you want to have dinner with me?</p><p>Just the two of us?</p><p>Well... and Julie.</p><p>It’s a thing we do when somebody new moves into the neighborhood,we invite them over for a home-cooked meal.</p><p>Sort of a tradition.</p><p>I thought you were a lousy cook.</p><p>Well, I order take-out.</p><p>You invite ’em for home-cooking and give ’em take-out?</p><p>Yeah, ah, it’s sort of a new tradition.</p><p>I’m working out the kinks.</p><p>I’ll tell you what. How about I cook?</p><p>You guys come over to my place.</p><p>Oh, great.</p><p>Friday night at six? I’ll be there.</p><p>Right. Come on.</p><p>Bye, Bongo.</p><p>Julie! Mike Delfino just invited usto dinner Friday night.</p><p>He did? Cool.</p><p>But only I’m going because you’regonna come down with something seriousthat requires bed rest and fluids.</p><p>Julie was glad Susan was rekindling her love life.</p><p>Of course, she was unaware of hermother’s recent track record with fire.</p><p>It’s all gone. Everything my ex-husbandworked for all those years, gone.</p><p>Don’t worry about clothing.</p><p>I already started a collection from the neighborhood.</p><p>What? I don’t want to wear other people’s old crap.</p><p>Edie, you can be homeless or ungracious.</p><p>You really can’t afford to be both.</p><p>That reminds me. My insurance check still hasn’t come yet.</p><p>Could I stay with you a few more weeks?</p><p>Of course. What kind of christian would I beif I denied shelter to a friend in need?</p><p>Oh, look. Here’s something we can salvage.</p><p>Your measuring cup.</p><p>We can scrape of the burnt part andit’ll look good as new.</p><p>That’s not my cup. Mine was plastic.</p><p>Well, how did it get in here?</p><p>I don’t know. Who cares?</p><p>Now, would you put that down and start looking for jewelry?</p><p>Dr. Albert Goldfine was the most accomplishedmarriage counselor in the city.</p><p>He had dealt with problems ranging from substance abuse...</p><p>...to infidelity...</p><p>...to domestic violence.</p><p>Yes, Dr. Goldfine thought he had seen it all.</p><p>And then he met the Van de Kamps.</p><p>Hi. I’m Bree. And this is my husband Rex.</p><p>And I brought you some homemade potpourri.</p><p>The answer is yes.</p><p>You’re about to make a fortune off us.</p><p>Ah, get off! Boys!</p><p>Guys, I’m begging you.</p><p>Sit in your seats.</p><p>I’m not gonna tell you again. Buckle up.</p><p>I mean it, so help me...</p><p>Oh, shoot. Crap!</p><p>I was playing with it first!</p><p>License and registration, please.</p><p>Ma’am, you know why I pulled you over?</p><p>I have a theory.</p><p>The kids should be sitting wearing seat belts.</p><p>I yelled at them. They never listen. It’s very frustrating.</p><p>You have to find a way to control them.</p><p>After all, that’s your job.</p><p>Though he’d been a policeman for six years,officer Hayes had never found himselfin a truly dangerous situation.</p><p>Then again, he had never before tolda woman how to raise her children.</p><p>Are you saying I’m a bad mother?</p><p>Get back in your car, please.</p><p>I have no help. My husband’s always away on business.</p><p>I’m gonna have to ask you to step back now.</p><p>My babysitter joined the witness relocation program.</p><p>I haven’t slept through the night...</p><p>...in six years Ma’am.</p><p>And for you to stand there and judge me...</p><p>Ok. I’m not gonna give you a ticket.</p><p>I’m just gonna let you off with a warning.</p><p>I accept your apology.</p><p>Mom! He’s kicking me again!</p><p>Buckle up.</p><p>Mrs. Solis. Hello, Jonathan.</p><p>Well, this is my room. Sorry about the mess.</p><p>Oh, uh, don’t worry about it.</p><p>You just missed my mom.</p><p>On friday,she coaches my sister’s soccer team.</p><p>Yes, I heard that.</p><p>John, we need to talk about what happened the other day.</p><p>Mr. Solis isn’t catching on, is he?</p><p>No, no, he doesn’t have a clue, god love him.</p><p>It’s just I was thinking that when you come over to garden,you might actually have to garden.</p><p>Great, you’re breaking up with me.</p><p>In my own bedroom.</p><p>No, no. I’m not dumping you.</p><p>Lately, you’ve been the only thing keeping me going.</p><p>But we can’t do it at my house anymore.</p><p>Oh, so then, where do you want to do it?</p><p>Well, what time does your mom get back from soccer practise?</p><p>Mrs. Solis!</p><p>Better hurry. We don’t have much time.</p><p>And so there’s just the four of us.</p><p>My older son, Andrew, is 16, Danielle is 15 and...</p><p>I don’t need to see pictures. Bree,you’ve spent most of the hourengaging in small talk.</p><p>Oh, have I ? Yes.</p><p>Rex has been very vocal about his issues.</p><p>Don’t you want to discuss your feelings about your marriage?</p><p>Um, doc...</p><p>This is the thing you got to know about Bree.</p><p>She doesn’t like to talk about her feelings.</p><p>To be honest, it’s hard to know if she has any.</p><p>Does she feel anger, rage, ecstasy?</p><p>Who knows?</p><p>She’s always pleasant, and I can’ttell you how annoying that is.</p><p>Whatever she feels, it’s so far below the surface,no one can see it.</p><p>I feel like she’s using all these...</p><p>Bree?</p><p>Bree? What? I’m sorry.</p><p>Would you like to respond to what Rex just said?</p><p>Oh, um... Is there some truth there?</p><p>Do you use housework as a way to disengage emotionally?</p><p>Of course not!</p><p>This is great. I got tons of homework tonight.</p><p>It’s easy to concentrate after sex.</p><p>I’m glad I could help.</p><p>Education’s very important.</p><p>Oh, I got something for you.</p><p>I was gonna give it to you next time Imowed your lawn, but since you’re here.</p><p>Oh, it’s a rose. It’s not just any rose.</p><p>Look at all the petals. There’s no flaws.</p><p>It’s perfect. Oh, John.</p><p>Just like you.</p><p>The truth hit her like a thunderbolt.</p><p>I spent days looking for just the right one.</p><p>I finally found it.</p><p>For John,this was no longer a meaningless little affair.</p><p>Gabrielle could now clearly seehe was falling in love with her.</p><p>It’s just beautiful.</p><p>I... I got to go.</p><p>Goodbye.</p><p>Hey, you. What are we having?</p><p>I talked to Julie and she suggested rib-eye steaks.</p><p>She said that’s your favorite. I love my steak.</p><p>Hi, Mike.</p><p>Susan.</p><p>Edie.</p><p>I’m sorry about your house. How you holding up?</p><p>All right, I guess. Oh, is somebody having a party?</p><p>No, Susan’s just throwing mea traditional welcome dinner.</p><p>Only I’m cooking. And having it at my house.</p><p>Traditional? Hm! I didn’t get one.</p><p>Oh, it’s a new tradition.</p><p>It won’t be anything fancy. Just a little home cooking.</p><p>Mm. That sounds so good.</p><p>Susan suddenly had an awfulfeling in the pit of her stomach.</p><p>I’ve been having nothing but fast food lately.</p><p>As if she was watching an accident in slow motion.</p><p>She knew it would happen, but was powerless to stop it.</p><p>Edie, would you like to join us for dinner?</p><p>Oh, that’s so sweet. No, I don’twant to intrude. Three’s a crowd.</p><p>No, it’s not like that. I mean, Susan’s bringing Julie.</p><p>It’s not like that. The more the merrier.</p><p>Well, this’ll be fun. All right. Tomorrow night.</p><p>We’ll eat at six. Great.</p><p>Oh, and Susan... Yeah?</p><p>This’ll make up for the dinner that you never threw me.</p><p>Right.</p><p>Ta-ta.</p><p>Should I have told her we were having steak.</p><p>She’s not a vegetarian or something?</p><p>Oh, no.</p><p>No, Edie’s definitely a carnivore.</p><p>Here’s, um...</p><p>Here’s what I pulled for Edie.</p><p>Most of the clothes aren’t that stylish.</p><p>Don’t worry about it. Edie’s a beggar now,which means she can’t be a chooser.</p><p>Of course, we don’t have to add salt to the wound.</p><p>Listen, I was just getting dinner ready...</p><p>Say no more. I’ll get out of your hair.</p><p>No, no.</p><p>By the way, was that you I saw getting pulledover by a policeman?</p><p>Yeah, the boys were acting up in the car,I couldn’t get them to sit down.</p><p>Young boys can be so willful.</p><p>I try everything.</p><p>I scream. I threaten. I reason.</p><p>I beg. Nothing works.</p><p>I don’t know if it’s becausethey’re too young and they don’t understand,or if they’re just getting some perverse joy out of testing me.</p><p>My mother used to have the worst time with me in the car,so one time when I was acting up,she stopped and left me on the side of the road,and she drove off.</p><p>You’re kidding?</p><p>Oh, she came back immediately,but I never misbehaved in the car again.</p><p>You should try that.</p><p>Mrs. Huber, I could never leavemy kids by the side of the road.</p><p>When it comes to discipline,sometimes you must be creative.</p><p>My mother knew that. Smart lady.</p><p>Of course, she’s in a home now.</p><p>And her mind has just turned to mush.</p><p>Well, like I said, I should go back and get dinner ready.</p><p>Oh, right, well... Goodbye.</p><p>Goodbye.</p><p>Susan, have you been able to find old clothes for Edie?</p><p>She has nothing to wear.</p><p>I thought that was the look she was going for.</p><p>Oh, Susan, Edie may be trash,but she’s still a human being.</p><p>Zach, is your dad home? I need to talk to him.</p><p>Hey, Paul, I hope I’m not interrupting.</p><p>Actually, I was getting ready to go somewhere.</p><p>I just wanted to come by and say hello,you know, see how you guys are doing.</p><p>We’re trying to move on. It’s been pretty tough.</p><p>I can only imagine.</p><p>Not knowing why Mary Alice...</p><p>Why what? Why she did it.</p><p>Oh. Here, let me help you. I’ve got it. I’ve got it.</p><p>I’m sorry if I upset you.</p><p>Can I be frank?</p><p>Of course.</p><p>I don’t care what her reasons were.</p><p>Maybe she was depressed, maybe she was bored.</p><p>It doesn’t matter.</p><p>She abandoned her husband and her sonand I’ll never forgive her.</p><p>As I watched Susan, I couldn’t help feeling sorry for her.</p><p>She wanted so much to know why I did it.</p><p>Why I killed myself.</p><p>It’s not enough to want the truth.</p><p>You must know where to look for it.</p><p>And the truth is elusivebecause it knows where to hide.</p><p>Hello, Julie, I talked to your momabout donating some clothes for Edie.</p><p>She’s at Mrs. Van De Kamp’s,but I’ll see if she left some stuff upstairs.</p><p>Oh, Julie, I-I was, um, just admiring your new measuring cup.</p><p>Yeah, we’ve lost ours. Really?</p><p>So I couldn’t find the clothes. Sorry.</p><p>That’s ok.</p><p>If you want me to keep looking.</p><p>No. You’ve done more than enough.</p><p>Truly.</p><p>Bree. Rex just called. He won’t be able to meet you here today.</p><p>Apparently, there was an emergency at the hospital.</p><p>Oh, well, I wish he’d called me.</p><p>He suggested perhaps you’d like to meet with me by yourself.</p><p>You’ve been very quiet in our joint sessions.</p><p>What?</p><p>Oh, oh, oh, no, thank you.</p><p>I have some things I need to do today.</p><p>Are you sure? Uh, yeah, I’m sure.</p><p>Ok.</p><p>Dr. Goldfine, there is something you can do for me.</p><p>What’s that? Take off your coat.</p><p>So you’re taking Julie on your dinner date with Mike?</p><p>Well, if Edie’s gonna be there,I’ll need emotional support.</p><p>I can’t believe she wormed her way in.</p><p>How did you let her do that?</p><p>I don’t know. I was going to take her out at the knees,but it all happened so fast.</p><p>Well, you know what you need to do.</p><p>You need to get there early,spend a little time with Mike before the little barracuda gets there.</p><p>That’s a good idea. Edie will get there at 5:45,which means her breasts will arrive at 5:30,so I should shoot for 5:00.</p><p>That a girl.</p><p>I’m just going to take these upstairs.</p><p>I’m going to keep my one little bag and go home.</p><p>That is a beautiful rose. Where did you get it?</p><p>Oh, John gave it to me.</p><p>John... your gardener, he gave you a rose?</p><p>Yes... I am having some new bushes planted outside,and he gave me that as a color palette.</p><p>Ok.</p><p>Sure is beautiful, isn’t it?</p><p>Yes, it is.</p><p>I’m sure Freud would not approve of this.</p><p>Oh, who cares what he thinks?</p><p>I took psychology in college.</p><p>We learned all about Freud.</p><p>A miserable human being.</p><p>What makes you say that?</p><p>Think about it.</p><p>He grew up in the late 1800s.</p><p>There were no appliances back then.</p><p>His mother had to do everything by hand,just backbreaking work from sun up to sundown.</p><p>Not to mention the countlessother sacrifices she had to maketo take care of her family, and what does he do?</p><p>He becomes famous peddling a theorythat the problems of most adultscan be traced back tosomething awful their mother has done.</p><p>She must’ve felt so betrayed.</p><p>He saw how hard she worked.</p><p>He saw what she did for him.</p><p>Did he even ever think to say thank you?</p><p>I doubt it.</p><p>There you go.</p><p>Just so you know, many of Freud’stheories have been discredited.</p><p>Good.</p><p>Boys, I am not gonna tell you again. Sit.</p><p>I mean it. I am serious.</p><p>You guys are gonna be in so much troubleif you don’t sit back in those seats.</p><p>For the first time,Lynette could see this was not the innocent play of children.</p><p>She was being challenged.</p><p>So she decided it was time to get creative.</p><p>Out! Can’t behave,you heard me, you cannot ride.</p><p>You, out, move it.</p><p>Where is she going?</p><p>Ok. Mommy’s a genius.</p><p>Five, six, all right.</p><p>Uh, mommy’ll be right back.</p><p>Boys? Boys?</p><p>Boys?!</p><p>Porter! Preston! Parker!</p><p>If you’re hiding, you’ve got to stop now,cause mommy doesn’t think it’s funny!</p><p>Oh! excuse me.</p><p>I’m sorry. I’m looking for my boys.</p><p>Three boys with red hair. Have you seen them?</p><p>Yeah. I also saw you drive away and leave them.</p><p>I know. I was just trying to scare them into behaving.</p><p>Did you see where they went?</p><p>Yeah, they’re in my kitchen.</p><p>Listen, it seems to me that youhave some anger management issues.</p><p>I have four kids under six.</p><p>I absolutely have anger management issues.</p><p>I think you need to talk to somebodybecause abandoning your children...</p><p>I didn’t abandon them. I came back.</p><p>I’m just saying it’s not normal.</p><p>My kids aren’t normaland now I don’t have time for this, lady, so –Boys, get out here.</p><p>I don’t think they should go anywhereuntil you calm down.</p><p>Get in the car. She’s got cookies.</p><p>Bring them, we’re leaving. Stay put.</p><p>I don’t think so. Oh! Listen, lady...</p><p>Leave my mommy alone. Let go of me.</p><p>What’s the matter with you? Son of bi... Ah!</p><p>Run, boys, run! Come on!</p><p>Oh, crap. Get back here.</p><p>Boys, you’re gonna need to put on your...</p><p>Get back or I’m gonna call social services.</p><p>Oh, my god! Carlos, what have you done?</p><p>I saw it when I drove by the dealership.</p><p>I thought Gabrielle will look beautiful in this.</p><p>Carlos!</p><p>It cost me an arm and a leg.</p><p>It’s got GPS navigation, 200 watt stereo system...</p><p>It is beautiful.</p><p>So did I take your breath away?</p><p>Absolutely.</p><p>Is it the best gift you’ve ever gotten?</p><p>Gabrielle could see what this gesture had cost Carlos,so she responded the only way she knew how.</p><p>She had a feling the truth would’vebeen lost on her husband anyway.</p><p>After all, it’s the rare man who understands the valueof a single perfect rose.</p><p>Susan. I hope you don’t mind.</p><p>I came by early to help you set up.</p><p>Oh, um... Hey, Susan.</p><p>Don’t worry, we have everything under control.</p><p>Bongo! I don’t know why he barks at you.</p><p>I wouldn’t take it personally.</p><p>Dogs are very sensitive.</p><p>What’s up, Bongo?</p><p>You never know what freaks them out, huh?</p><p>In the distance, Susan thought she heard a bell ring.</p><p>Is it a strange noise?</p><p>What is it? A weird smell?</p><p>Round one...had started.</p><p>All I’m saying isthis whole it takes two to messup a marriage theory is bull.</p><p>The problems that we have are because of her.</p><p>That is not true, Rex.</p><p>What have I been doing for the past20 years that’s been so awful?</p><p>You’re not saying anything becauseI’ve been a great husband.</p><p>And it kills you to admit that.</p><p>Rex, I’m curious.</p><p>Do you ever acknowledge the benefits of living with Bree?</p><p>Huh? By your own admission,your home’s always clean,your clothes always freshly pressed,sounds like a wonderful cook,despite her flaws,do you ever remember to say thank you?</p><p>Thank you? Yes.</p><p>Bongo! Get down! Down!</p><p>Go away. Down. I’m sorry. I’m sorry.</p><p>So who’s the guy that lives across from Mrs. Huber again?</p><p>That’s Mr. Mullen. If he invites you in,you have to meet all of his pets.</p><p>That’s ok. I love animals.</p><p>He’s a taxidermist.</p><p>Oh, ok, thanks for the warning.</p><p>Isn’t Mr. Mullen’s brother your divorce attorney?</p><p>Uh, yes, yes, he was.</p><p>Can I say something?</p><p>In my heart, I still believe that youand Karl are gonna get back together.</p><p>Really? Oh, yeah.</p><p>I’ve never seen two people more in love.</p><p>She’s never gonna find that kind ofchemistry with another man.
