I think she’s been shot.</p><p>There’s blood everywhere.</p><p>Yes, you’ve got to send an ambulance.</p><p>You’ve got to send one right now.</p><p>And, for a moment,Mrs. Huber stood motionless in her kitchen,grief-stricken by this senseless tragedy.</p><p>But only for a moment.</p><p>If there was one thing Mrs. Huber was known for,it was her ability to look on the bright side.</p><p>I was laid to rest on a Monday.</p><p>After the funeral, all the residents of Wisteria Lanecame to pay their respects.</p><p>And, as people do in these situations,they brought food.</p><p>Lynette Scavo brought fried chicken.</p><p>Lynette had a great family recipe for fried chicken.</p><p>Of course, she didn’t cook muchwhile moving up the corporate ladder.</p><p>She didn’t have the time.</p><p>But when her doctor announced she was pregnant,her husband Tom had an idea.</p><p>”Why not quit your job?””Kids do better with stay-at-home moms.””It would be so much less stressful.”But this was not the case.</p><p>In fact, Lynette’s life had become so hecticshe was now forced to get her chickenfrom the fast-food restaurant.</p><p>Lynette would’ve appreciatedthe irony if she’d thought about it.</p><p>But she couldn’t. She didn’t have the time.</p><p>Stop it, stop it, stop it. But, mom.</p><p>No. You are going to behave today.</p><p>I am not going to be humiliatedin front of the entire neighborhood.</p><p>And, just so you know how seerious I am...</p><p>What’s that?</p><p>Santa’s cell-phone number.</p><p>How did you get that?</p><p>I know someone who knows someone who knows an elf.</p><p>And if any of you acts up,so help me, I will call Santaand I will tell him you want socks for Christmas.</p><p>Are you willing to risk that?</p><p>Ok.

At the Donahue party,everyone was talking mutual funds.</p><p>You found a way to mentioned you slept withhalf the Yankee outfield.</p><p>I’m telling you, it came up in the context of the conversation.</p><p>Hey, people are starting to stare.</p><p>Can you keep your voice down, please?</p><p>Absolutely. We wouldn’t wantthem to think we’re not happy.</p><p>Bree Van De Kamp, who lives next door,brought baskets of muffins she baked from scratch.</p><p>Bree was known for her cooking,and for making her own clothes,and for doing her own gardening,and for re-upholstering her own furniture.</p><p>Yes, Bree’s many talents were knownthroughout the neighborhood.</p><p>Everyone on Wisteria Lane thought ofBree as the perfect wife and mother.</p><p>Everyone, that is, except her own family.</p><p>Paul. Zachary.</p><p>Hello, Mrs. Van De Kamp.</p><p>Bree, you shouldn’t have gone to all this trouble.</p><p>It was no trouble at all.</p><p>Now, the basket with the red ribbonis filled with desserts for your guests,but the one with the blue ribbonis just for you and Zachary.</p><p>It’s got rolls, muffins,breakfast type things.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Well, the least I could do is make sureyou boys had a decent mealto look forward to in the morning.</p><p>I know you’re out of your minds with grief.</p><p>Yes, we are.</p><p>Of course, I will need the baskets back once you’re done.</p><p>Of course.</p><p>Susan Mayer, who lives across the street,brought macaroni and cheese.</p><p>Her husband, Karl, always teased her about her macaroni,saying it was the only thing she knew howto cook and she rarely made it well.</p><p>It was too salty the night sheand Karl moved into their house.</p><p>It was too watery the night shefound lipstick on Karl’s shirt.</p><p>She burned it the night Karl told herhe was leaving her for his secretary.</p><p>A year had passed since the divorce.</p><p>Susan had started to think how nice itwould be to have a man in her life.</p><p>Even one who would make fun of her cooking.</p><p>Mom, why would someone kill themselves?</p><p>Well, sometimes people are so unhappy,they think that’s the only way to solve their problems.</p><p>Mrs. Young always seemed happy. Yeah.</p><p>Sometimes people pretend to be one way,when they’re totally different on the inside.</p><p>Oh, you mean like how dad’s girlfriend always smiling and saysnice things, but we know she’s a bitch.</p><p>I don’t like that word, Julie.</p><p>But, yeah, that’s a great example.</p><p>You’re welcome.</p><p>What’s going on?</p><p>Sorry I’m late.</p><p>Hi, Susan. Hey.</p><p>So, what did Karl say when you confronted him?</p><p>You’ll love this. He said...</p><p>”It doesn’t mean anything. It was just sex.”Ah, yes, page one of the philanderer’s handbook.</p><p>Yeah, and then he got this zen look on his face,and he said, ”you know, Susan,most men live lives of quiet desperation.”Please tell me you punched him.</p><p>No. I said, ”Really? And what do most womenlead lives of noisy fulfillment?”Hmm. Good for you.</p><p>I mean, of all people,did he have to bang his secretary?</p><p>I had that woman over for brunch.</p><p>It’s like my grandmother always said –an erect penis doesn’t have a conscience.</p><p>Even the limp ones aren’t that ethical.</p><p>This is half the reason I joined the NRA.</p><p>Well, when Rex started going to those medical conferences,I wanted it in the back of his mind thathe had a loving wife at homewith a loaded Smith &amp; Wesson.</p><p>Lynnie, Tom’s always away on business.</p><p>Do you ever worry he might?</p><p>Oh, please, the man’s gotten me pregnant three times in four years.</p><p>I wish he was having sex with someone else.</p><p>So, Susan, is he gonna stop seeing that woman?</p><p>I don’t know.</p><p>I’m sorry, you guys, I just...</p><p>I just don’t know how I’m gonna survive this.</p><p>Listen to me.</p><p>We all have moments of desperation.</p><p>If we can face them head-on, that’s whenwe’d find out how strong we really are.</p><p>Susan.</p><p>Susan.</p><p>I was just saying Paul wants us to go over on friday.</p><p>He needs us to go to Mary Alice’s closetand help pack up her things.</p><p>He says he can’t face doing it by himself.</p><p>Sure. That’s fine. Are you ok?</p><p>Yeah. I’m just so angry.</p><p>If Mary Alice was having problems,she should have come to us. She should’ve let us help her.</p><p>What problems could she have had? She was healthy,had a great home, a nice family. Her life was...</p><p>Our life.</p><p>No. If Mary Alice was having a crisis,we’d have known.</p><p>She lives 50 feet away, for god sakes.</p><p>Gabby, the woman killed herself.</p><p>Something must’ve been going on.</p><p>I wouldn’t eat that if I were you. Why?</p><p>I made it. Trust me.</p><p>Hey, hey, do you have a death wish?</p><p>No, I just refused to believe that anybodycan screw up macaroni and cheese.</p><p>Oh, my god.</p><p>How did you...? It tastes likeit’s burnt and undercooked.</p><p>Yeah, I get that a lot. Here you go.</p><p>Thanks. I’m Mike Delfino.</p><p>I just started renting the Sims’ house next door.</p><p>Susan Mayer.

So if you ever have a clog...</p><p>...or something.</p><p>Now that everybody’s seen that I brought something,I should probably just throw this out.</p><p>Ease up, you little vampire.</p><p>Lynette, I’ve been looking all over for you.</p><p>Are you aware of what your sons are doing?</p><p>Cannonball!</p><p>Stop!</p><p>What are you doing?

Things below the surface.</p><p>The morning after my funeral, my friendsand neighbors quietly went backto their busy, busy lives.</p><p>While some did their cooking...</p><p>...And some did their cleaning...</p><p>...And some did their yoga...</p><p>...Others...</p><p>...did their ”homework”.</p><p>Hi...</p><p>I’m Julie. I kicked my soccer ball into your backyard.</p><p>Oh, ok. Well, let’s go round and get it.</p><p>StayHis wife died a year ago. He wanted to stay in LA,but here were too many memories.</p><p>He’s renting for tax purposes,but hopes to buy a place soon.</p><p>I can’t believe you went over thereHey, I saw you both flirting at the wake.</p><p>You are obviously into each otherNow you know he’s single, you can ask him out.</p><p>Julie, I like Mr. Delfino, I do.</p><p>I just... I don’t know if I’m ready to start dating yet.</p><p>You need to get back out there.</p><p>Come on. How long has it been since you’ve had sex?</p><p>Are you mad that I asked you that?</p><p>No, I’m trying to remember.</p><p>I don’t want to talk to you about my love life any more.</p><p>It warns me outI wouldn’t have said anything.It’s just...</p><p>What?</p><p>I heard dad’s girlfriend ask if you’ddated anyone since the divorce.</p><p>And dad said he doubted it.</p><p>And then they both laughed.</p><p>Hey, Susan.</p><p>Hi, Mike. I brought you a little house-warming gift.</p><p>I should’ve brought something by earlier, but Actually, you’re the first to stop by. Really?</p><p>Susan knew she was lucky.</p><p>An eligible bachelor had moved on to Wisteria Lane Welcomeand she was the first to find out.</p><p>But she also knew that good news...</p><p>Hello there. ...Travels quickly.</p><p>Edie Britt was the most predatorydivorce in a five-block radius.</p><p>Her conquests were numerous.</p><p>Varied.</p><p>and legendary.</p><p>Hi, Susan.

And she was a slut.</p><p>Thank you. What’s this?</p><p>Sausage puttanesca.</p><p>It’s just something I threw together.</p><p>Well, thanks, Edie.</p><p>That’s... great. I’d invite you both in,but I was sort of in the middle of something.</p><p>I’m late for an appointment.</p><p>I just wanted to say hi.</p><p>And just like that, the race for Mike Delfino had begun.</p><p>For a moment, Susan wondered if her rivalry with Ediewould remain friendly.</p><p>Oh, Mike, I heard you’re a plumber.</p><p>But she was reminded that when it came to men...</p><p>Do you think you could stop by later and take a look at my pipes?</p><p>...Women don’t fight fair. Sure.</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>Bye, Susan.</p><p>You can’t order me around like I am a child.</p><p>Gabrielle.</p><p>No, no. I’m not going.</p><p>It’s business. Tanaka expects everyone to bring their wives.</p><p>Every time I’m around that man, he tries to grab my ass.</p><p>I made over 200,000 doing business with him last year.</p><p>If he wants to grab your ass, you let him.</p><p>John.</p><p>Mr. Solis, you scared me.</p><p>Why is that bush there? You were supposed to dig it up last week.</p><p>I didn’t have time. I don’t want to hear your excuses.</p><p>Just take care of it.</p><p>I really hate the way you talk to me.</p><p>And I hate that I spent $ 15,000 on your diamond necklacewhich you couldn’t live without.</p><p>But I’m learning to deal with it.</p><p>So can I tell Tanaka we’ll be there tomorrow?</p><p>John, we have bandages top shelf in the kitchen.</p><p>Thanks, Mrs. Solis.</p><p>Fine, I’ll go.</p><p>But I’m keeping my back pressedagainst the wall the entire time.</p><p>See, now this is what a marriage is all about.</p><p>Compromise.</p><p>Is your finger ok? Yeah, it’s just a small cut.</p><p>Let me see. Mmm.</p><p>You know, Mrs. Solis, I really like it when we hook up,but, um, you know, I got to get my work done and...</p><p>...I can’t afford to lose this job.</p><p>This table was hand-carved.</p><p>Carlos had it imported from Italy.</p><p>It cost him $ 23,000.</p><p>You want to do it on the table this time?</p><p>Absolutely.</p><p>Why can’t we ever have normal soup?</p><p>Danielle, there is nothing abnormal about basil puree.</p><p>Just once,couldn’t we have a soup that people have heard of?</p><p>Like French onion or navy bean.</p><p>First of all, your father can’t eat onions.</p><p>He’s deathly allergic. And I won’teven dignify your navy bean suggestion.</p><p>So... how’s the osso buco?</p><p>It’s ok. It’s ok?</p><p>Andrew, I spent three hours cooking this meal.</p><p>How do you think it makes me feel when yousay ”it’s okay” in that sullen tone?</p><p>Who asked you to spend three hours on dinner?</p><p>Excuse me?</p><p>Tim Harper’s mom gets home from work,pops open a can of pork and beans,and boom, they’re eating. Everyone’s happy.</p><p>You’d rather I serve pork and beans?</p><p>Apologize now. I am begging.</p><p>I’m saying,do you always have to serve cuisine?</p><p>Can’t we ever just have food?</p><p>Are you doing drugs? What?</p><p>Change in behavior is one of the warning signs,and you have been as fresh aspaint for the last six months.</p><p>That certainly would explainwhy you’re always locked in the bathroom.</p><p>Trust me, that is not what he is doing.</p><p>Shut up.</p><p>Mom, I’m not the one with the problem here, all right?</p><p>You’re the one always acting likeshe’s running for mayor of Stepford.</p><p>Rex... Seeing that you’re the head of this household,I would really appreciate you saying something.</p><p>Pass thee salt?</p><p>Three days after my funeral,Lynette replaced her grief with a much more useful emotion.</p><p>Indignation.</p><p>Tom, this is my fifth message,and you still haven’t called me back.</p><p>Well, you must be having a lot of funon your business trip. I can only imagine.</p><p>Well, guess what – The kids and I want to have some fun, too,so unless you call me back by noon,we are getting on a plane and joining you.</p><p>Mom.</p><p>Not now. Mommy’s threatening daddy.</p><p>Mom. No, I...</p><p>Where are your brothers? Noodles, my favorite.</p><p>Lyneettee Scavo? Crap.</p><p>Natalie Klein. I don’t believe it.</p><p>Lynette.

Everyone misses you.</p><p>We all say if you hadn’t quit,you’d be running the place by now.</p><p>Yeah, well.</p><p>So... How’s domestic life?</p><p>Don’t you just love being a mom?</p><p>And there it was. The question that Lynette always dreaded.</p><p>Well, to be honest...</p><p>For those who asked it, only one answer was acceptable,So Lynette responded as she always did. She lied.</p><p>It’s the best job I’ve ever had.</p><p>You know what I don’t get? What?</p><p>Why you married Mr. Solis.</p><p>Well... He promised to give meeverything I’ve ever wanted.</p><p>And did he? Yes.</p><p>Then why aren’t you happy?</p><p>Turns out I wanted all the wrong things.</p><p>So do you love him?</p><p>I do.</p><p>Well, then, why are we here? Why are we doing this?</p><p>Because I don’t want to wake up one morningwith a sudden urge to blow my brains out.</p><p>Hey, can I have a drag? Absolutely not.</p><p>You are much too young to smoke.</p><p>How would you feel about me using yourchild-support payments for plastic surgery?</p><p>Stop being so nervous. You’re justasking him to dinner. No big deal.</p><p>You’re right.</p><p>So is that your project for school?</p><p>You know, when I was in fifth grade,I made the White House out of sugar cubes.</p><p>Stop stalling and go.</p><p>Before Mike figures out he can do better.</p><p>Tell me again why I fought for custody of you.</p><p>You were using me to hurt dad. Oh, that’s right.</p><p>Oh, god.</p><p>Hi. Hey, Susan.</p><p>Are you busy?</p><p>No, not at all. What’s up?</p><p>Well, I... I just, uh, was wondering if...</p><p>...if there was any chance that you, uh...</p><p>...I just wanted to ask if...</p><p>Edie. Hey, there, Susan.</p><p>What are you...? I was making ambrosia.</p><p>And I made too much so I thoughtI’d bring some over to Mike.</p><p>What’s going on?</p><p>Susan was just going to ask me something.</p><p>I have a clog. Excuse me?</p><p>And you’re a plumber, right? Yeah.</p><p>The clog’s in the pipe. Yeah,That’s usually where they are.</p><p>Well, I’ve got one.</p><p>Ok. Let me get my tools.</p><p>Now?

Everything is just great.</p><p>Okay, well, I got you the honey mustard dressing.</p><p>The ranch looked just a little bit suspect.</p><p>Are we going to talk about what I said?</p><p>If you think I’m going to discuss the dissolutionof my marriage in a placewhere the restrooms are labeled ”chicks” and ”dudes,”you’re out of your mind.</p><p>What’s in this?</p><p>What do you mean, what’s in this? It’s salad.</p><p>With... with onions. What?</p><p>You put onions in my salad. No, I didn’t.</p><p>Oh, wait.</p><p>The sound that awakened my son wassomething he’d heard only once before.</p><p>Many years ago when he was quite young.</p><p>But he recognized it instantly.</p><p>It was the sound of a family secret.</p><p>Seven days after my funeral, life on Wisteria Lanefinally returned to normal.</p><p>Which, for some of my friends, was unfortunate.</p><p>Mommy, mommy! Now what?</p><p>Daddy’s home!</p><p>Come on! Hey, is anybody home?</p><p>I wasn’t expecting you for a week.</p><p>I have to go back to ’Frisco in the morning.</p><p>But I got your call.

Let’s risk it.</p><p>Let’s risk it? Yeah.</p><p>I can’t believe you tried to kill me.</p><p>Yes, well, I feel badly about that.</p><p>I told you Mrs. Huber came overand I got distracted. It was a mistake.</p><p>Since when do you make mistakes?</p><p>What does that mean?</p><p>It means I’m sick of you beingso damn perfect all the time.</p><p>I’m sick of the bizarre way your hair doesn’t move.</p><p>I’m sick of you making our bed in themorning before I’ve used the bathroom.</p><p>You’re this plastic suburban housewife,with her pearls and spatula,who says things like ”we owe the Hendersons a dinner.”Where’s the woman I fell in love with...</p><p>...Who used to burn the toast anddrink milk out of the carton?</p><p>and laugh.</p><p>I need her.</p><p>Not this cold, perfect thing you’ve become.</p><p>These need water.</p><p>Bree sobbed quietly in the restroom for five minutes,but her husband never knew.</p><p>Because when Bree finally emerged...</p><p>...she was perfect.</p><p>I found my earrings. We can go now.</p><p>Was John here today?</p><p>Well, yeah.</p><p>The lawn hasn’t been mowed. I’ve had it.</p><p>We’re getting a real gardener.</p><p>Why?

Mrs. Huber, how are you doing?</p><p>Not too well, I’m afraid.</p><p>I’m trying to find something to soothe my stomach.</p><p>It’s upset? Yeah.</p><p>I had the worst macaroni and cheese at the wake.</p><p>It’s been running through me ever since.</p><p>And I need to be at my best.</p><p>Edie Britt’s son is spending the night tonight.</p><p>He’s spending the night?</p><p>Apparently Edie is having a gentleman friend over for dinner,and I think she plans on entertaining into the wee hours,if you know what I mean.</p><p>Oh, here’s some antacid. Have you ever tried this?</p><p>I can’t believe it. This can’t be happening.</p><p>Mike can’t like Edie better than me. He just can’t.</p><p>You don’t know what’s going on.</p><p>Maybe they’re just having dinner.</p><p>You’re right. They’re doing it.</p><p>Edie?</p><p>Edie?</p><p>Hello?
