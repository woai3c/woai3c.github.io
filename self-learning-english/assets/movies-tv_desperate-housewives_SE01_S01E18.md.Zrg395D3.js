I know the sacrifice you’re making.</p><p>There’s still a part of methat’s hoping to change your mind.</p><p>Once you had a baby,I think you would love it so much that...</p><p>Honey, it’s not gonna happen.</p><p>You never know. No, sometimes you do.</p><p>Well, it is a sacrifice.</p><p>But you’re worth it.</p><p>Yes, Gabrielle Solis knew without a doubtshe didn’t want to be a mother.</p><p>But what she couldn’t know wasjust how much her husband wanted to be a father,or that he’d been tampering withher birth control for months...</p><p>or that within one week’s time...</p><p>she’d be pregnant.</p><p>Saturdays on Wisteria Lane belonged to the children,and while most would spend the day practicing their sports...</p><p>and riding their bikes...</p><p>and jumping their ropes,others were no longer engaged in child’s play.</p><p>Indeed, some children were being forcedto grow up very quickly.</p><p>Sorry to bother you on the weekend.</p><p>We just have a few questions for you.</p><p>About what?</p><p>12 years ago,your late wife purchased a toy chest.</p><p>Toy chest?</p><p>Yeah, it was about this big, had little dancing bears on it.</p><p>Gosh, I’m sorry.</p><p>The craftsman who makes these chestskeeps a list of customers.</p><p>Apparently, you purchased one in august 1992.</p><p>We’d like to know where that chest is now.</p><p>Wow, I, uh... I wish I could help you.</p><p>I don’t recall any toy chest.</p><p>I remember.</p><p>It had little bears and balloons on it, right?</p><p>Yes, son, that’s right.</p><p>We threw it away when I was little.</p><p>I was standing on it and it busted.</p><p>Remember, dad? Vaguely.</p><p>I guess that’s all, then.</p><p>Thank you both for your time.</p><p>Hey. What’s the deal with this chest, anyway?</p><p>One just like you had washed up on Torch Lake.</p><p>Had a woman in it. A woman?</p><p>She was all chopped up.</p><p>Obviously, we need to talk.</p><p>You lied to me. You said it was a man in the box.</p><p>No, I didn’t lie.</p><p>The policeman said it was a woman’s body.</p><p>Of course you were lying.</p><p>I told youa private detective had come to take you away from us.</p><p>I never said it was a man.</p><p>You didn’t? No.</p><p>I-I thought that... No.</p><p>Stop. Please stop.</p><p>I know you’re lying to me, ok? I know that you’re lying.</p><p>For the last time,someone came and tried to take you away from us.</p><p>Yes, a woman. A woman came.</p><p>Yes, she tried to steal youfrom the only family that you’d ever really known.</p><p>And we couldn’t let that happen, and we didn’t.</p><p>And that...</p><p>...is the truth.</p><p>We can’t cancel now. It’s two days away.</p><p>Rex, I’m not going. That’s all there is to it.</p><p>Counseling is part of the treatment at Camp Hennessey.</p><p>You knew that.</p><p>Nowhere in that brochure did it saythat we were expected to attend.</p><p>What’s Andrew going to think if you don’t show up?</p><p>Well, I am making him this care package.</p><p>I mean, he’ll know that I’m thinking about him.</p><p>Why are you putting in lemon squares?</p><p>They told us not to send him sweets.</p><p>I don’t understand why.</p><p>I guess they feel baked goods from momundercut the boot camp experience.</p><p>Fine, I won’t send them,but I think it’s a stupid rule.</p><p>So are you going to this thing or not?</p><p>No. Why?</p><p>Because the minute I get there, Andrew will start...</p><p>...attacking me for abandoning him.</p><p>And I don’t want to hear it.</p><p>There’s no reason to feel guilty, you know.</p><p>You did everything you could for him.</p><p>I don’t feel guilty.</p><p>Ok.</p><p>Please, Christy.</p><p>There’s no way I can get another babysitter this late in the day.</p><p>Parker, knock it off. No.</p><p>Because I’m having drinks with friends I used to work with,and they never called, and if I blow them off,that’s it... I’m dead to them.</p><p>No, I can’t call Patty Binks.</p><p>Because she steals things.</p><p>Damn it, Christy, you’re 13 years old.</p><p>You got a lot of trips to the mall ahead of you.</p><p>Ok, ok, I’m sorry.</p><p>I’m sorry I raised my voice.</p><p>I’m calm.</p><p>So I’m starting to think that this is about money.</p><p>So what is it that would make it worth your while?</p><p>A hundred! That’s extortion.</p><p>There’s no way in hell that I’m gonna...</p><p>Hello?</p><p>Hello?</p><p>Parker, I swear, I will spank you. Knock it off.</p><p>Hi, Mrs. Binks. Is Patty there? Thank you.</p><p>Hi, honey. I’m back.</p><p>Hey, sweetie.</p><p>This is Mr. Steinberg, the attorney from the hospital.</p><p>Oh, have we met?</p><p>Yes, Mrs. Solis. We’ve met.</p><p>Don’t you remember?</p><p>It was after mama died.</p><p>Apparently the hospital was negligentand agreed to a 7-figure settlement check,a check I was never told about.</p><p>Oh, that.</p><p>I...</p><p>Mr. Steinberg... I was just leaving.</p><p>What were you thinking?! Wait, just let me explain...</p><p>No, why the hell didn’t you tell me?!</p><p>Because I couldn’t trust you to make the right decision.</p><p>The right decision was to use that money for my lawyers!</p><p>We could have fought the indictment,and then I wouldn’t have had to take the plea bargain!</p><p>If you didn’t take the plea deal,the government would have seized the settlement.</p><p>We could have fought that in court.</p><p>Exactly,and then you would have blown all the money on the lawyers.</p><p>Who cares?!</p><p>If there was a chance didn’t have to go to jail.</p><p>You had Laotian convictssewing casual wear for two cents an hour.</p><p>Don’t you think you deserve a time-out?</p><p>Eight months. Thanks to you,I’m going away for eight months.</p><p>And when you get out,we’re going to have money to start over with thanks to me.</p><p>You know, once you calm down,you’re gonna realize I did the right thing,and when that happens, I’d appreciate an apology.</p><p>Grandma’s here.</p><p>Now, that is just perfect.</p><p>Stay put.</p><p>I am so sorry! Hey, mom.</p><p>Oh, hey, Susie.</p><p>I goofed. What happened?</p><p>Oh, you know me. No depth perception whatsoever.</p><p>I’m stunned they even issued me a license.</p><p>So, you’re Susan’s mom.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>I’m Sophie Bremmer. And you are?</p><p>Mike Delfino.</p><p>You’re Mike?! Oh, my god!</p><p>Susan’s told me so much about you!</p><p>Well, don’t just stand there. Give me a hug!</p><p>Mom. Uh... Mike and I aren’t... together anymore.</p><p>Oh! Sorry.</p><p>I guess I just made this pretty awkward, huh?</p><p>Yeah, you... You really did.</p><p>So let’s just call the insurance company.</p><p>Ok.</p><p>Well... It’s nice meeting you anyway, Mike.</p><p>You too. I never would’ve guessed you were Susan’s mom.</p><p>I know. I look too young.</p><p>I got pregnant when I was a tiny teenager.</p><p>Ok...</p><p>It was the first time I got drunk, ever.</p><p>Can you believe it? Let’s go.</p><p>Her father was a marine.</p><p>Afterwards, he gave me three of his medals.</p><p>Mom! What?</p><p>Let’s just go inside and call the insurance company.</p><p>Oh, right.</p><p>What are you smiling about?</p><p>I used to have all these questions abouthow you got to be the way you are.</p><p>They were all just answered.</p><p>What’s going on?</p><p>My babysitter cancelled.</p><p>Lynette, I’m so swamped today.</p><p>My house is a mess and I’ve got millions of errands to run.</p><p>Please hear me out. This is important.</p><p>Today, I have a chance to rejoin the human racefor a few hours.</p><p>There are actual adults waiting for me with Margaritas.</p><p>Look, I’m in a dress. I have make-up on.</p><p>If it were any other day.</p><p>Oh, for god’s sakes, Bree, I’m wearing pantyhose.</p><p>Bring them in. Thank you, thank you.</p><p>Ok, in you go.</p><p>Then the police showed me his mug shot.</p><p>No! Yes.</p><p>Mike served time for selling drugs and manslaughter.</p><p>I can’t believe it. Well, it’s true.</p><p>He has such nice manners. You know? I know.</p><p>Susie, I don’t want you worrying too much about this Mike thing.</p><p>The right man will come along. Just give it time.</p><p>I think I would have given up entirelyif it weren’t for you and Morty.</p><p>Morty? Yeah, you know.</p><p>It’s the third time around for both of youand you’re really clicking.</p><p>Oh. It gives me hope.</p><p>What’s wrong? Nothing, nothing. Um...</p><p>I’m just... I’m tired.</p><p>You’re not tired. You took a nap. What is it?</p><p>I left Morty. What?! Why?</p><p>Because he shoved me.</p><p>Morty? No!</p><p>You think I’m lying? Fine!</p><p>Why would he shove you? Because I confronted him.</p><p>About how much time he’s spendingat that damned pancake restaurant.</p><p>If that’s where he’s really been.</p><p>Oh, you can’t be serious. Morty?</p><p>You think men his age don’t have needs?</p><p>You should see the waitresses he hires.</p><p>Every year, they get younger and younger.</p><p>Maybe you just feel that way becauseevery year you get older and older.</p><p>That’s a horrible thing to say. I’m sorry.</p><p>I’m not that old. I said I was sorry.</p><p>People think we’re sisters.</p><p>That’s ’cause you tell them that.</p><p>One time. You’ve gotta let go of that.</p><p>Ok, look. I am just sayingthat I don’t think morty cheated on you.</p><p>Well, he did shove me.</p><p>And the least you can do is be supportive.</p><p>You’re right. You’re right.</p><p>He also threw a book at me. Oh, come on!</p><p>I mean... he shouldn’t have done that.</p><p>Huh. Thank you.</p><p>Porter, honey, those cookies are hot.</p><p>Wait a few minutes and I’ll give you one, ok?</p><p>You know, pictures are prettierif you color inside the lines.</p><p>Well, art is subjective.</p><p>Porter! What did I tell you? But I’m hungry.</p><p>Then I will fix youa very nice bowl of peaches and cottage cheese.</p><p>Ew! Barf! Don’t be common, young man.</p><p>Come on. If you play with those cookies one more time,I’m gonna have to spank you.</p><p>We don’t get spanked. Really?</p><p>Mommy always says she’s gonna but she never does.</p><p>Well, I am not your mommy.</p><p>And if you misbehave in my house,you will get spanked.</p><p>So be good.</p><p>It was an accident. Porter, I warned you.</p><p>I’m sorry. I’ll be good.</p><p>Those cookies were made from scratch.</p><p>Your fate is sealed.</p><p>Come here.</p><p>No, no!</p><p>What’s that?</p><p>It’s called a post-nuptial agreement.</p><p>It’s a legal document...</p><p>I know what a post-nup is.</p><p>What is it doing on my coffee table?</p><p>I can forgive that stuntyou pulled with the settlement check,If I’m sure you’ll really be around when I get out of jail.</p><p>And the post-nup changes the terms of the pre-nup, so...</p><p>So if you try and divorce me while I’m gone...</p><p>...you get nothing.</p><p>You don’t trust me?</p><p>I’m afraid not. Well, that’s too bad.</p><p>Because I’m not signing that piece of paper.</p><p>You’re a very beautiful woman, Gabrielle.</p><p>But... you’re not very bright.</p><p>If you don’t sign it,I’ll pull the plug on the settlement agreement, divorce you,and then you get what amounts towhich is basically nothing.</p><p>So what do you expect to happen right now, Carlos?</p><p>I’ll sign the paper and jump right back into your arms?</p><p>It doesn’t mean that I don’t love you.</p><p>You know I think you’re the perfect woman.</p><p>Oh, but I’m not. I have flaws.</p><p>Flaws?</p><p>I’ll give you an example.</p><p>Remember the time when you were in jailand you told me about your secret compartmentand you told me to burn the papers that I found in there?</p><p>Well, me being pretty and therefore stupid,I forgot.</p><p>You didn’t burn the papers.</p><p>Worse. I read them.</p><p>Ok, ok... You have some nerve talking to me about trustwhen you have a secret bank account in the Cayman Islands!</p><p>That was a safety net for both of us. I’ll bet.</p><p>Have you told anyone about this? No, but I could.</p><p>Isn’t that why the prosecutiondidn’t have a case against you?</p><p>They couldn’t find the profits you made.</p><p>So if I were you, I wouldn’t mention the wordsdivorce, trust, or post-nup ever again.</p><p>You don’t wanna piss me off.</p><p>I know, baby. It hurts to lose.</p><p>Ante up.</p><p>Well, look at me!</p><p>Finally in on one of your legendary poker parties.</p><p>Susan’s always telling me how much fun you have.</p><p>The rules are simple. We play for cash,the dealer picks the game,and unsubstantiated gossip is encouraged.</p><p>Bree, thanks again for watching my boys.</p><p>They weren’t too much to handle?</p><p>We had a wonderful time.</p><p>Although I think Porter had a little less fun.</p><p>Ok, I’ll bet.</p><p>So, Sophie,Susan says you’re going to the Spa tomorrow.</p><p>Is it an all-day thing?</p><p>What do you mean, Porter had less fun?</p><p>I’ll raise.</p><p>He misbehaved, so I had to punish him.</p><p>Yes, Susan is treating me to an entire day of...</p><p>When you say punishment, what exactly are we talking about?</p><p>Oh, I had to spank him.</p><p>Ok, I will re-raise.</p><p>You spanked my son?</p><p>Las Brisas Spa.</p><p>Yup, that’s where we’re going.</p><p>Lynette, is there a problem?</p><p>Tom and I don’t believe in hitting our kids.</p><p>Sorry, I didn’t know.</p><p>It won’t happen again.</p><p>Of course, I’m somewhat surprised you don’t spank them.</p><p>Everybody knows they’re a little bit...</p><p>out of control.</p><p>Wow, I am dragging today.</p><p>Shall we put on another pot of coffee?</p><p>Yeah, I’ll do it.</p><p>I’ll... I’ll fold.</p><p>Yeah, you’re right, Bree.</p><p>I’ve got a lot to learn about parenting.</p><p>I feel so blessed to be getting sage advicefrom an impeccable mother like you.</p><p>Your kids turned out perfect, if you don’t count Andrew.</p><p>Where is he, again?</p><p>Some kind of a boot camp for juvenile delinquents?</p><p>Ok, girls.</p><p>I never said I was perfect.</p><p>Honey, nobody’s blaming you.</p><p>The hell I’m not.</p><p>Lynette...</p><p>If you will excuse me.</p><p>Lynette, will you go after her?</p><p>She spanked my son.</p><p>I’m not apologizing.</p><p>Usually, poker is more fun than this.</p><p>So help me, if you don’t back me up on this, I will lose it.</p><p>Yes, Bree shouldn’t have spanked Porter.</p><p>But it’s not like she hurt him.</p><p>That is not the point.</p><p>You don’t spank other people’s children.</p><p>He was misbehaving. She had to do something.</p><p>But make no mistake, she definitely crossed the line.</p><p>Damn right.</p><p>She could’ve tried something else, like a time-out,or she could’ve simply threatened to spank him.</p><p>Yeah, ’cause that works out so well when we do it.</p><p>It does work. It does work most of the time.</p><p>It used to work.</p><p>They’ve figured out it’s an empty threat.</p><p>They’re onto us.</p><p>My mom used to beat the hell out of my sisters and me,and I won’t do it.</p><p>I will not become my mother.</p><p>Fine.</p><p>But the boys are getting older and smarter.</p><p>And eventually, believe me,They’ll figure out that they outnumber us and then...</p><p>we’re screwed.</p><p>Exactly.</p><p>Excuse me, Zachary.</p><p>Would you mind helping me with these bags?</p><p>There’s some banana bread in it for you if you do.</p><p>Uh, yeah, sure.</p><p>Mm. This is really good, Mrs. Tillman. Thanks a lot.</p><p>You’re welcome, Zachary.</p><p>I’ve never been in Mrs. Huber’s house before.</p><p>Obviously you haven’t missed much.</p><p>This is the place where good taste goes to die.</p><p>So, I heard you and your father arguing the other day.</p><p>Everything all right at home? Yeah.</p><p>We just have... problems, sometimes.</p><p>I bet you miss your mother.</p><p>I’m sure things were... different when she was alive.</p><p>Such a warm, loving woman.</p><p>You...</p><p>...knew my mother?</p><p>Yup. Years ago, in Utah.</p><p>We worked together.</p><p>I didn’t know that. It’s true.</p><p>In fact...</p><p>...I’ll tell you a secret.</p><p>I once met you when you were a little baby.</p><p>Really?</p><p>Your mother loved you so much, Zachary.</p><p>Of all the things I remember,I remember that the most.</p><p>You wanna know what else I remember?</p><p>How lovely your original name was.</p><p>Dana?</p><p>Isn’t this nice?</p><p>Just the two of us girls hanging out,getting pretty.</p><p>Oh, thank you. My pleasure.</p><p>So, I was thinking maybe you should call Morty.</p><p>You know, get started working things out?</p><p>Why work things out with a man who abuses me?</p><p>You don’t have to gasp. My mother exaggerates.</p><p>She won’t be happy till I have bruises.</p><p>Um, can we just focus? What I want to know is,have you thought aboutwhat’s going to happen if you don’t go back to Morty?</p><p>What do you mean?</p><p>Well, you don’t have a place to live,you don’t like to work,you didn’t want to marry Mortyso he doesn’t have to pay you alimony.</p><p>If you don’t go back to this manwho allegedly shoved you once in five years,what are your options?</p><p>I thought I could live with you.</p><p>What?!</p><p>Oh, god! Are you all right?!</p><p>Get away! I’m so sorry.</p><p>I was startled.</p><p>Here, lean your head back.</p><p>I’m not saying permanently,just a couple of years.</p><p>You broke my nose.</p><p>No, it’s just banged a little.</p><p>Till I get back on my feet.</p><p>Can we talk about this later?</p><p>Should we call 911?</p><p>It’s just a nosebleed. She’s fine.</p><p>I thought you’d be excited by the idea.</p><p>It’s not that I’m not excited.</p><p>I’m not stupid, Susan.</p><p>It’s obvious you don’t want me here.</p><p>No, that’s not true! Mom, don’t go!</p><p>Mom, come back!</p><p>You know, I need to...</p><p>We’re good, right? Just go.</p><p>Why aren’t you dressed yet?</p><p>I wanted to wear Andrew’s favorite colorand then I realized that...</p><p>...I don’t know what it is.</p><p>Honey, I think the fact you decided to comeat all will make him happy.</p><p>Yours is blue.</p><p>Danielle loves pink.</p><p>And I have no idea what my own son’s favorite color is.</p><p>I’m telling you, it doesn’t matter.</p><p>How can you say that?</p><p>Of course it matters. Bree...</p><p>That is a good mother.</p><p>Someone who knows their child inside and outso that if they get in trouble,they know what to do.</p><p>I don’t know him well enough.</p><p>You are a good mother.</p><p>Brown or green? I... just don’t know.</p><p>I’m gonna wait in the car.</p><p>Whenever you’re ready.</p><p>Green.</p><p>I’ll go with the green. Everybody loves green.</p><p>I told you. I’m not signing this.</p><p>Oh, I think you are.</p><p>Because if you don’t, I will divorce you.</p><p>Then I’ll go to the police.</p><p>And tell them what?</p><p>There’s a secret bank accountin the Cayman Islands that no longer exists?</p><p>You moved the money? Of course I moved the money.</p><p>That was risky.</p><p>I mean, the feds are watching you right now.</p><p>I had to do something.</p><p>I couldn’t just let you make a fool out of me.</p><p>Oh! stop, Carlos, stop it!</p><p>Put me down! Ok.</p><p>Put me down!</p><p>Let me go!</p><p>Stop! You’re hurting me, Carlos!</p><p>Sign it.</p><p>Sign it!</p><p>I know, baby.</p><p>It hurts to lose.</p><p>Mr. and Mrs. Van de Kamp?</p><p>Uh, yes. Is it our turn?</p><p>Well, uh, sort of. Andrew’s waiting inside but, uh...</p><p>What’s wrong?</p><p>Well, he said he won’t go forward with the session if...</p><p>his mother’s involved.</p><p>He only wants to talk to his dad.</p><p>We drove 200 miles to be here today.</p><p>This is unacceptable.</p><p>Yeah, I share your frustration.</p><p>To hell with him, then. We’re going home.</p><p>No. I’m not gonna let him insult you like this.</p><p>He blames me for his being here.</p><p>He blames me for everything.</p><p>And he’s probably right.</p><p>Any mistakes made were made by both of us.</p><p>One of us should go talk to him, see how he is.</p><p>I’m OK.</p><p>Are you sure? Yeah, I’m fine.</p><p>Right this way.</p><p>Mom! Mom!</p><p>I’m coming. What is it? Why aren’t you guys brushing your teeth?</p><p>Perk, what happened?</p><p>Porter pushed me and it fell in.</p><p>He pushed me first. Can I flush it?</p><p>No, no, I’ll fish it out later.</p><p>You’re off the hook tonightbut not you two, so start brushing.</p><p>Preston, did you not hear me?</p><p>I said start brushing your teeth.</p><p>What are you doing?</p><p>Don’t you dare.</p><p>Do it! Do it!</p><p>Don’t listen to them.</p><p>Back away from the toilet and no one gets hurt.</p><p>Do it! Do it!</p><p>I mean it this time. These are not just words.</p><p>Do it! Do it!</p><p>If you do this, so help me...</p><p>Hearing the hollowness of her own voice,Lynette realized that it was time to get one step ahead.</p><p>Do it! Do it!</p><p>I will walk you over to Mrs. Van de Kamp’sand we all know what happens when she gets mad.</p><p>Now...</p><p>Go brush your teeth. I want ’em to sparkle. Go on.</p><p>Sorry you had to bring your kid back.</p><p>What happened this time?</p><p>A couple of months back,I caught Tug going through my purse.</p><p>Oh, I hate when they do that.</p><p>Was he looking for weed or money?</p><p>Who knows at this point?</p><p>Anyway, I’d knocked a couple back and things got heated.</p><p>Pretty soon we’re both screaming,throwing stuff round the apartment.</p><p>Next thing you kown, lady upstairs calls the cops.</p><p>Oh, give me a break.</p><p>So, now I got some social workertrying to tell me how to raise my boy.</p><p>Kids! boy, if I knew then what I know now,I would’ve had that hysterectomy 20 years ago.</p><p>Uh, Bree... Don’t get up. I’ll be quick.</p><p>Andrew, all any parent can do is provide their childwith the tools to succeed in life.</p><p>Education, love, a good clean, safe home.</p><p>I’ve given you those things and I’m through feeling guilty.</p><p>If you wanna piss your life awayand blame it on how horrible things are at home, go ahead.</p><p>But I want it stated for the recordthat I’m a good mother. Do you hear me?</p><p>I am a good mother.</p><p>Bree...</p><p>Andrew just told me he thinks he might be gay.</p><p>What?!</p><p>That’s why he wanted me to come in first.</p><p>He thought I could take it better.</p><p>Well, he was right. I will be waiting in the car.</p><p>Mrs. Solis. What are you doing here?</p><p>Ok. Are your roommates here?</p><p>No.</p><p>Are you ok? Yeah.</p><p>What’s this? That? Uh...</p><p>Carlos just got a little rough. Made me sign some papers.</p><p>He hurt you?</p><p>What are you doing? I’ll take care of this.</p><p>You are not gonna do anything. We can’t let him get away with it.</p><p>Look, if you really wanna get back at him, then kiss me.</p><p>How’s that gonna help? Because...</p><p>one day when the time is right,I’m gonna tell him how he drove me right into your arms.</p><p>And that’s gonna kill him.</p><p>And tonight, just... whatever you do,don’t call me beautiful.</p><p>Oh, Morty, look who’s here.</p><p>Hey, Millie. Hi, Morty.</p><p>Susie, what brings you here?</p><p>Mom. I brought her over.</p><p>What’s she doing out there?</p><p>She says she won’t come in until you apologize to her.</p><p>For what? For shoving her.</p><p>I only shoved her because she wouldn’t stop hitting me.</p><p>Why was she hitting you?</p><p>I threw a... I threw a book at her.</p><p>Morty! It was a paperback.</p><p>Well, even so! At least I missed.</p><p>I mean, she... she hit me square in the gut.</p><p>Wanna see the bruise? That’s ok. That’s ok.</p><p>It really hurt. Yeah, I understand.</p><p>So...</p><p>Could you, uh, just go out and apologize?</p><p>No. Why?</p><p>’cause I don’t want her back. Morty!</p><p>Look, I love her,but the pancake shack is just starting to take off.</p><p>We’re talking about opening another one.</p><p>That’s practically a chain.</p><p>I don’t have time for her hysterics.</p><p>I sympathize, I really do.</p><p>But you have to take her back. Why?</p><p>Because she wants to move in with me.</p><p>I’d like to have a relationship again,and at my age, with a kid,if she moves into my house,even for a couple of years, I’m doomed.</p><p>Wasn’t there a plumber?</p><p>Your mother said you were in love with a plumber.</p><p>I am. I mean, I was.</p><p>It didn’t work out. I’m sorry.</p><p>If she moves in,she will burn up all my oxygen and I need it.</p><p>Please, can’t you give her another chance?</p><p>You guys are really good together, you know?</p><p>When you’re... when, when, when there’s no violence.</p><p>Well, we do have chemistry.</p><p>Absolutely.</p><p>And, you know, the sex was like... Wow!</p><p>I mean, there was this one time,we were coming home on the interstate...</p><p>You don’t have to sell me. Just go talk to her.</p><p>Now.</p><p>Ok.</p><p>That was a mighty big sigh.</p><p>I just keep thinking it’s coming, and I can’t stop it.</p><p>What’s that?</p><p>The day my mother will need to move inand I won’t have a choice.</p><p>I know it’s years away.</p><p>She’s youthful and vibrant, thank god.</p><p>But time flies.</p><p>One day she won’t be able to take care of herself anymore.</p><p>And I’ll have to step up. I suppose that’s true.</p><p>I think it’s nature’s little joke,that children ultimately end up parenting their parents.</p><p>Well, when that day comes, I’ll be ready.</p><p>Honey, you’d better get out there.</p><p>Stop it! Aaagh!</p><p>What are you doing?</p><p>Porter says he can’t catch me!</p><p>Look, I just wanted to apologize...</p><p>Lynette, don’t.</p><p>The fact that you just crossed that streetmeans the world to me.</p><p>And if anyone here should apologize, it’s me.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Looks like Tom’s got the mob under control.</p><p>Wanna have some coffee, sit around,bitch about our kids...?</p><p>I would love to. Ok.</p><p>Children come into the world with their own agendas.</p><p>Some to brighten our days.</p><p>Some to test our patience.</p><p>Some to give us purpose.</p><p>Some to take care of us.</p><p>Yes, when they come,children change everything.</p><p>Especially when they’re not invited.</p>',617),h=[n];function s(i,r,u,l,d,y){return o(),t("div",null,h)}const g=e(a,[["render",s]]);export{w as __pageData,g as default};
