Do you?</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Turn around, Michelle. Let me see the back of it. I like it a lot. It fits well. It doesn&#39;t need any alterations. We must&#39;ve bought the right size.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: I like the color. She looks good in blue.</p><p><strong>Michelle</strong>: I like blue, too, Daddy.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Try on the skirt and blouse outfit, Michelle—the one that Daddy wanted you to wear.</p><p><strong>Michelle</strong>: OK.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: Michelle has been a different kid since we&#39;ve been married. She&#39;s never been happier.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: And I&#39;ve never been happier, Harry. I love her very much. She&#39;s been a joy.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: We&#39;re very lucky, the three of us...and becoming part of the Stewart family, too.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: We couldn&#39;t ask for anything more, could we?</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: Well...</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Well...? Could we ask for anything more?</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: Well...we...</p><p><strong>Michelle</strong>: How do you like it, Daddy?</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: It&#39;s my favorite outfit.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: It&#39;s good for every day. It will be good for school, Michelle.</p><p><strong>Michelle</strong>: I like it, too. I always like skirts that go like this. Do you want to see the winter jacket on me, Susan?</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Yes, I do. Change back into your jeans, and put on the new winter jacket we bought today.</p><p><strong>Michelle</strong>: OK.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: What did you mean by &quot;well...?&quot; You had something on your mind when I said we couldn&#39;t ask for anything more.</p><p><strong>Michelle</strong>: Is everything all right?</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: Everything is fine, Michelle.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Let&#39;s take a look at the winter jacket. Come on over here, Honey.</p><p><strong>Michelle</strong>: It&#39;s kind of warm.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: It is. That&#39;s why we bought it for you. This will be a perfect jacket for the wintertime when it&#39;s very cold out. But it&#39;s kind of small also. We must&#39;ve bought the wrong size.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: Looks like we should&#39;ve bought a bigger one. I guess we&#39;ll have to exchange it, too. I&#39;m sure the store has others.</p><p><strong>Michelle</strong>: I look silly! It is too small!</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: You&#39;re growing so fast, Michelle.</p><p><strong>Michelle</strong>: Can I take it off? I&#39;m hot!</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Sure. Put it back in your room, and we&#39;ll hang everything up later.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Well, are you going to tell me what&#39;s on your mind, Harry?</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: I have been offered a job with a major accounting company in Los Angeles.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Los Angeles? That&#39;s a big decision.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: I know. It will also affect you and your job, if we decide to go.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Wow! It sure will. But first tell me about the job, Harry. If it&#39;s a good one, then we&#39;ll make it work for us.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: I have a client in the garment business, on Seventh Avenue. I do his taxes every year. He has a big sales office in Los Angeles, and the company in Los Angeles that does his major accounting work is looking for an executive. And he recommended me.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: That&#39;s wonderful, Harry.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: Yes, but it would mean that we&#39;d have to move to L.A.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: What about the salary?</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: The real discussion comes tomorrow. Susan, I don&#39;t plan to make any decisions until I have a chance to talk with you about it.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: I understand, Harry.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: And I don&#39;t have to make a quick decision. They know that I&#39;m married and that I have a family.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Well, there&#39;s a lot to think about. If it&#39;s a good job, then I&#39;ve got to do some thinking about my career opportunities in Los Angeles.</p><p><strong>Michelle</strong>: Is everything OK?</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Yes, honey.</p><h2 id="act-2" tabindex="-1">Act 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#act-2" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Act 2&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Hello. Hello there. Are you ready for lunch with your grandpa?</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Oh! Hi, Grandpa. Yes, of course, I am, but my mind isn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: What&#39;s the matter, Susan?</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: A real dilemma.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Does it have anything to do with you and Harry?</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Yes, but I don&#39;t know where to start.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Maybe I can help. Tell me what it is, Susan.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Thanks, Grandpa. Please sit down. Oh! Harry has been offered a job in Los Angeles.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Well, this is something to think about.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: There are so many things to consider. There&#39;s Michelle. I wonder if a move would be a bad thing for her. And my job. I don&#39;t know if I can get a good job in Los Angeles. And what about our family?</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Can I tell you what I think?</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Tell me.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: I think that you&#39;re very successful and that you have a fantastic reputation in the toy industry. I think you could talk to Mr. Marchetta, and I think he could help you find a really good job in Los Angeles. He was very helpful to me, remember?</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: I suppose I could call him. But I&#39;m not so sure that I want to leave New York, you, and the rest of our family.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Well, I&#39;m not going to kid you, Susan. You know we&#39;d all miss you. But this should be your decision. It&#39;s something that only you and Harry can work out.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: If moving to L.A. is in Harry&#39;s best interest, I have to do what I can do to support him.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: In every marriage, sacrifices have to be made by one partner from time to time.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: And what about Michelle?</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Well, what do you think?</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: I think Michelle is better off staying where she is.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: What does she think?</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: I don&#39;t know for sure.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Well, you&#39;ll have to ask her.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: I think I&#39;m going to have a talk with Mr. Marchetta and get his feelings about my leaving. And about helping me find a job in Los Angeles.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Good idea.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: I&#39;ll call him right now. No point in delaying. Thanks, Grandpa.</p><p><strong>Bill</strong>: Harry, it&#39;s the perfect job for you. You&#39;ll love it.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: It&#39;s a big decision for me, Bill. And I have to discuss it with my wife. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s right for her.</p><p><strong>Bill</strong>: She&#39;ll love it. It&#39;s a once-in-a-lifetime offer, Harry.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: OK. Tell it to me again.</p><p><strong>Bill</strong>: The company is Craft and Craft, the biggest accounting company in the country.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: I know the company well. It&#39;s big.</p><p><strong>Bill</strong>: The biggest.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: Yeah, yeah. The biggest. When do I have to let you know?</p><p><strong>Bill</strong>: Talk it over. Think it over. Let me know by the end of the week.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: When would we have to move?</p><p><strong>Bill</strong>: As soon as possible.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: I also have my daughter to consider. I don&#39;t want to interrupt her school year.</p><p><strong>Bill</strong>: Let me know by the end of the week. It&#39;s a great opportunity for you, Harry. Believe me.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: I know.</p><p><strong>Bill</strong>: Craft and Craft is the biggest in the country.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: Yeah, I know. The biggest.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: I think Michelle is asleep now. Let&#39;s talk.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: I met with Bill York today.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: And I talked with Mr. Marchetta. Did York make the offer?</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: Yup. He asked me if I want the job.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: That&#39;s exciting, Harry. What was it?</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: A vice-presidency with the biggest accounting company in the country—Craft and Craft.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Aren&#39;t you excited about that?</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: Sure I am. But there&#39;s so much more to consider.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: I talked to Mr. Marchetta.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: What did he say? Did you tell him about me?</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Of course, Harry. I want what&#39;s best for you, and I think I can get a good job through Mr. Marchetta in Los Angeles also.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: You&#39;re kidding.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: No, I&#39;m not kidding. I talked with him, and he understands completely. He has a major toy buyer in Los Angeles, and he&#39;s pretty sure that I can get a good job there.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: Unbelievable!</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: But I think we should talk to Michelle about all of this.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: You&#39;re right. We&#39;ll talk to her about it.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: And how do you feel about taking the job in Los Angeles?</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: How should I feel? It&#39;s the biggest company in the country.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Well, then you feel good about taking it?</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: Well... I feel fine about it. Why shouldn&#39;t I?</p><h2 id="act-3" tabindex="-1">Act 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#act-3" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Act 3&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Michelle</strong>: I love my school. I have so many good friends there now. I wouldn&#39;t miss a day even if I were really sick.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Come and sit down for a minute, Michelle. I&#39;d like to talk to you about something. Something important.</p><p><strong>Michelle</strong>: What&#39;s wrong, Susan?</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Oh, there&#39;s nothing wrong, Michelle. But your daddy and I are talking about something that I&#39;d like your opinion about.</p><p><strong>Michelle</strong>: I know. I heard you talking about it the other night when I was trying on my new clothes. It&#39;s about moving to Los Angeles.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: You&#39;re right. How do you feel about it?</p><p><strong>Michelle</strong>: Well, I really wouldn&#39;t want to move, but...</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: But?</p><p><strong>Michelle</strong>: But if you and Daddy wanted to, I guess you know what&#39;s best for the family and for me.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: That&#39;s very considerate of you, Michelle. But what about your friends?</p><p><strong>Michelle</strong>: I&#39;d miss them a lot, but I know what it feels like to miss someone.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Honey, we don&#39;t have to move if you&#39;re not going to be happy about it.</p><p><strong>Michelle</strong>: Does Daddy want to move?</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: I think so. He&#39;s going to tell us tonight about the job offer.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: Well, how was everybody&#39;s day today?</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Michelle was chosen to do the school poster for the play this year.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: Congratulations, Michelle! That&#39;s something! And how was your day, Susan?</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: I see you&#39;re in a good mood. Why don&#39;t you tell us about your day.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: I met with Bill York.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: It&#39;s OK to talk about it, Harry. Michelle knows all about it.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: Really?</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Really, Harry. Michelle and I have all kinds of feelings about leaving New York, the family, and friends. But if you think you should take the job, we&#39;re behind you.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: What about Michelle&#39;s school?</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: We&#39;ll move after the school term.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: What about her new friends?</p><p><strong>Michelle</strong>: I&#39;ll make new friends wherever we are as long as we&#39;re together.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: We&#39;re a family, Harry. Whatever you think is right for you is right for us.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: I am so touched. The two of you are really something.</p><p><strong>Michelle</strong>: We love you, Daddy.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: And I love you.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: OK. Now, tell us about your talk with Mr. York. Did you take the job?</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: Nope.</p><p><strong>Michelle</strong>: What?</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: No? You didn&#39;t take it?</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: No, I did not take the job.</p><p><strong>Michelle</strong>: But, Daddy, I thought...</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Harry, you didn&#39;t turn it down because of me...</p><p><strong>Michelle</strong>: Or me?</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: No, no. I turned it down because of me.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: How&#39;s that?</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: Well, I began to think about you and about Michelle, and then I asked myself, do I really want to work for the biggest company in the country?</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: And?</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: And I don&#39;t. I went into business for myself because I like being my own boss. I run my own company. I&#39;m a big fish in a little pond. I&#39;m not really sure I want to be a little fish in a big pond.</p><p><strong>Michelle</strong>: Oh, Daddy, does that mean we don&#39;t have to move?</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: That&#39;s right, sweetheart.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Are you sure?</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: I couldn&#39;t be more sure, Susan.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: I&#39;m glad if you are, Harry.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: And besides, how could I live in Los Angeles when all my favorite people live here?</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Your favorite people?</p><p><strong>Michelle</strong>: Who&#39;s that?</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: The Stewart family, of course.</p>',163),a=[s];function i(g,l,p,h,u,d){return e(),o("div",null,a)}const m=t(r,[["render",i]]);export{c as __pageData,m as default};
