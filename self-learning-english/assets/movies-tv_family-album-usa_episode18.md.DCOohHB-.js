The election&#39;s next month.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: What&#39;s wrong with wanting to be on the school board?</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Nothing. But he wants to cut the school budget!</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Maybe it needs cutting.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Cutting the budget is fine, but he wants to do it by cutting all the cultural programs. No music, no dance, no concert, no stage presentations.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Why does he want to do that?</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: He says it&#39;s to save the taxpayers&#39; money, and I think he believes that the taxpayers will vote for him if he spends less on the cultural programs.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: He&#39;s probably right. Lots of people want their taxes used for new books and a new paint job in the schoolrooms.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Maybe some of us would like to pay a little bit more and keep the cultural programs for our kids.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Well, I&#39;m not sure, Ellen. I hear it from my patients. Lots of people are tired of higher taxes.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: I know, but if Boswell wins he&#39;ll be an important decision-maker on the school board, and he doesn&#39;t know anything about our children&#39;s education.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Who&#39;s running against him?</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Nobody. That&#39;s the problem.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Well, it sounds to me like Carter Boswell is going to win this seat on the board.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Oh, not if I can stop him!</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: And how are you going to stop him?</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: I don&#39;t know. Maybe I&#39;ll run against him.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Well, you&#39;ve got my vote.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: I&#39;m serious, Philip. Why shouldn&#39;t I run?</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Why shouldn&#39;t you run for what, Mom?</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Your mother is thinking of running for the school board.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Hey, that&#39;s terrific, Mom!</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Against Carter Boswell? Great!</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Well, if I run for office, the voters will have a clear choice. I stand for everything Boswell doesn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: I think a lot of people will vote for you against Boswell, Ellen. I&#39;ll vote for you.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Will you help me if I do run?</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Absolutely.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: The trouble is it takes a little bit of money to run a campaign.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: I think you can make a difference, Ellen. And in a short campaign you wouldn&#39;t need as much money. You know something, Ellen? Why not give the people of Riverdale a clear choice? I&#39;m with you. You can make a difference.</p><p><strong>Maxwell</strong>: Come in.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Mr. Maxwell?</p><p><strong>Maxwell</strong>: Yes, Charles Maxwell.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: My name is Ellen Stewart.</p><p><strong>Maxwell</strong>: Hello. Please, sit down. You asked to see me. What would you like to see me about?</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: I&#39;d like your help.</p><p><strong>Maxwell</strong>: Well, I&#39;m editor of the most influential newspaper in Riverdale. Actually, it&#39;s the only newspaper. A lot of people would like my help. Do you have a story?</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: I&#39;m planning to run for the school board.</p><p><strong>Maxwell</strong>: Against Carter Boswell?</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Yes.</p><p><strong>Maxwell</strong>: Well, that is news.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Will you announce that I&#39;m running?</p><p><strong>Maxwell</strong>: Sure. But I need some information.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Of course.</p><p><strong>Maxwell</strong>: Why will the voters vote for you against Boswell, Mrs. Stewart?</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Because I care.</p><p><strong>Maxwell</strong>: &quot;Vote for Ellen Stewart. She cares.&quot; Not a bad slogan. But what do you care about?</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Well, I care about the children of our town. I don&#39;t want them to grow up without cultural programs in our school.</p><p><strong>Maxwell</strong>: Do you have a plan?</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: I want our children to learn more than reading, writing, and arithmetic. I want to keep the after-school programs—the music, the concerts.</p><p><strong>Maxwell</strong>: It&#39;s not a bad plan. But who&#39;s going to pay for all of this?</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: We are. The citizens of Riverdale, of course. I plan to get help from the businessmen and the corporations of Riverdale.</p><p><strong>Maxwell</strong>: That&#39;s fair enough. Exactly what do you want from me, Mrs. Stewart?</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: You don&#39;t know me. I can&#39;t expect you to take my side against Boswell. But I do need some publicity so that the people of our town know that I&#39;m running for office and that I care about our children.</p><p><strong>Maxwell</strong>: Fair enough. I certainly can print the news. And you are now making news.</p><h2 id="act-2" tabindex="-1">Act 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#act-2" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Act 2&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Here are the fliers, hot off the press!</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Looks good. Simple.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Right over there, Grandpa. You fold the fliers, Richard and I will put them into the envelopes.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: We finished addressing over three hundred envelopes.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Need another box?</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Good work, gang.</p><p><strong>Mike</strong>: Hi, this is Mike Johnson. Can I speak with Mr. or Mrs. Anderson? Thanks.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Mr. Nelson. Hi. This is Robbie Stewart. Did you know my mother is running for the school board?</p><p><strong>Jimmy</strong>: Yes, Miss Kim, Ellen Stewart. &quot;She cares.&quot; Oh, see you at the polls.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Certainly, I&#39;ll give her your best wishes, Mr. Nelson.</p><p><strong>Mike</strong>: Hi, this is Mike Johnson. Can I speak with Mr. or Mrs. Burns? Thank you.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: We have done so much in such a short amount of time. I can&#39;t believe it! Wait till Philip comes and sees our progress!</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Everyone saw the story in the Riverdale newspaper.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Mr. Maxwell was very kind to print my announcement.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: It helps enormously. Everybody in Riverdale reads his paper.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Your photo in it helped, too.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Thanks to you, Richard, it&#39;s a good picture.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Well, hi, all.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong> &amp; Robbie: Hi, Dad.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Hello, darling.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: May I... may I help?</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Licking envelopes.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: I fold the fliers.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: We stuff them.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: And I lick the envelopes.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Hey, everybody, Mrs. Greenberg is on the phone. She says Carter Boswell is on the TV right now—doing a commercial.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: What channel?</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Five.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Five?</p><p><strong>Boswell</strong>: ...and if you ask what I care about, I&#39;ll tell you. I care about the school buildings in need of paint. I care about more lockers for the teachers. I care about new fixtures in the hallways—not music or dancing or entertainment. I care about the practical things. If you do, vote for me, Carter Boswell.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: A lot of people will agree with him.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: I told you.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Too bad kids can&#39;t vote. It&#39;s our school, but we can&#39;t vote.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: There are people in favor of the cultural programs, Mom.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: There are, Ellen. Don&#39;t be upset by Boswell&#39;s commercial.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: You have to go on television, too.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Boswell&#39;s a powerful speaker.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: You can be, too. Your ideas are good ones.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m up to it.</p><h2 id="act-3" tabindex="-1">Act 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#act-3" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Act 3&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: ...my slogan is &quot;I care&quot;.

My name is Ellen Stewart, and I&#39;m running for the open seat on the school board. My slogan is &quot;I care&quot;. What does the word care mean?... I care about people, not things. Vote for me, Ellen Stewart. I care.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: I like it, but now what? How can we possibly get it on so Riverdale will see it and hear it?</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Leave it to me.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: ...I mean that when I say &quot;I care&quot;. I care about people, not things. Vote for me, Ellen Stewart. I care.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: What happened?</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Mom is now on television in every appliance store in Riverdale, except Hamlin&#39;s. He&#39;s a Boswell voter.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: That&#39;s a brilliant idea, Richard!</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: You inherited your father&#39;s brains.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: We got our brains from you, Dad.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: And guess what? I called channel five. Their TV news is going to cover it. &quot;Housewife campaigns in appliance stores.&quot; And I&#39;ll bet some magazine will pick up the story, too.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Mom, you&#39;re going to win! I know it!</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Hold it, Robbie! Just cool down. I know we&#39;re getting some attention now, but in the end the voters will have to decide.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: You&#39;re going to win. Trust me!</p><p><strong>Reporter</strong>: In the hotly contested race for the one seat on the Riverdale School Board, Mrs. Ellen Stewart has taken an early lead.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: She&#39;s winning!

Riverdale High School beat its rival Horace Mann in baseball today...</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: It&#39;s too soon to know for certain.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: You&#39;re ahead. That&#39;s better than being behind.</p><p><strong>Reporter</strong>: More sports after this.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: It&#39;s not over yet. Let&#39;s just all calm down, and wait for the final results.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Ellen, why don&#39;t you go out to the backyard and get some fresh air?</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Thank you, Grandpa. I need some.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: What happened?</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: You came very close, Ellen.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: You lost by only a hundred and twenty-one votes.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: I lost.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: You tried, Mom.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: You lost by a very small number of votes.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Only one hundred and twenty-one votes! I&#39;m sorry, Mom.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: There just wasn&#39;t enough time.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Look, you&#39;ve made a very strong impression on our community. You&#39;ll have another chance next election.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Hello. Oh, yes, yes, Mr. Maxwell.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Hello, Mr. Maxwell.</p><p><strong>Maxwell</strong>: How are you? I just called to tell you that you are very impressive. You lost the election, but you won the attention of the residents of Riverdale, of Boswell, and of me.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Well, thank you, Mr. Maxwell. I appreciate your kind words. I needed that.</p><p><strong>Maxwell</strong>: I hear Boswell wants to appoint you to a special arts committee. I&#39;m sending over a reporter in the morning to interview you.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: You are?</p><p><strong>Maxwell</strong>: I&#39;m going to do an article on &quot;Ellen Stewart—she cares.&quot; Maybe we&#39;ll all care now. Good-bye.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Thank you—and good-bye.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: What was that about?</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: You were right, Philip.
