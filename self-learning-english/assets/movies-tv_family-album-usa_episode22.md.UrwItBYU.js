The cradle will rock. When the bough breaks, The cradle will fall, And down will come baby, Cradle and all.&quot;</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Hi, Marilyn. What are you doing?</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Just sketching. I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about our responsibilities in the past few weeks.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: I never stop thinking about them.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: I&#39;ve been wrestling with the question of whether I should go back to work or not.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: I see.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: And I&#39;m torn. I really want to go back to work, use my talents, and pursue my career in fashion design. But I also want to be a full-time mother, especially when he&#39;s a baby.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: I really understand, Marilyn. But you never have to worry about Max. There&#39;s Mother and Grandpa...and I can always arrange my photo schedule around your schedule, if that will help.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: It&#39;s not the same, Richard.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Have you discussed going back to work with your boss?</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Rita Mae called yesterday.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Ah! That&#39;s what&#39;s got you thinking, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: She wants to know when I think I&#39;ll be returning to the boutique.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: And you said...?</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: I said I&#39;d give her an answer in a few days...that I wasn&#39;t sure.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: I&#39;m sure Rita Mae will understand and wait until you&#39;re ready to go back to work.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Well, maybe she will, and maybe she won&#39;t. Who knows? If I don&#39;t accept her offer, maybe she&#39;ll find someone else in the meantime, and when I&#39;m ready to go back, there won&#39;t be a job for me.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: That&#39;s something to consider. You&#39;ve got yourself to think about, too.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: But I am thinking about myself. Don&#39;t you see?</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: It&#39;s not just the job. It&#39;s also my career as Max&#39;s mother. That&#39;s the way I look at it. I have two career opportunities at the same time. My career as a fashion designer and my career as a mother.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: I never really thought about being a mother as a career. I guess you do have two career opportunities and a decision to make.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: I hear Max.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: I&#39;ll go to him.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: No, that&#39;s OK. I&#39;ll do it.</p><h2 id="act-2" tabindex="-1">Act 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#act-2" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Act 2&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: There&#39;s your teddy bear, Max.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: He just loves that teddy bear that Grandpa Philip bought for him.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: I took him to Philip&#39;s office yesterday for a checkup. You should have seen the look on his face when Molly gave him the injection.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Oh, did he cry?</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: No, my dear little boy just looked up at me as if to say, &quot;Mama, what are they doing to me? Help!&quot;</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: How did you feel? Tell the truth—didn&#39;t you feel terrible?</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: I sure did. I held him closely. I kissed the top of his dear little head. He looked up at me and tried to smile. Being with him helped.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Helped him? Or helped you?</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Being a mother is not easy, if that&#39;s what you mean.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Speaking of being a mother, I&#39;ve been meaning to ask you what you&#39;re thinking about regarding going back to work. I know Rita Mae called. I can imagine what&#39;s going through your head.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: I&#39;m sure you can, Ellen.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: There are so many things to consider. One thing that makes it easier for you is that you have us. Max will always have a family member to watch over him while you&#39;re at work. I didn’t have that when Richard and Susan were born.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: What did you do?</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: I chose to continue with my career as a music teacher. We hired a woman to watch Richard and then Susan, and I continued with my career.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Do you think you made the right decision?</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: I think I did. But when Robbie was born, I decided to give full-time attention to raising Robbie. I felt differently at that time.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: And you gave up your career as a music teacher?</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Not exactly. I continued to teach piano lessons at home.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: How did you feel about being away when Susan and Richard were babies?</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: I think I did the right thing for them, for myself, and for Philip. We needed the money. Remember?</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Well, we do too, Ellen. Everything I earn helps us get that house we want and need.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: I can’t wait until Max is a little older. Our toy company makes the most wonderful toys for kids.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Max thanks you. I thank you. And Richard thanks you. Now, may I please say hello?</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Hello. Hello. I miss Max and think about him all week long. We talk about him at dinner time.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Will you please try to relax? I’ve never seen you so wound up.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: You seem to be enjoying the pressure.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: The truth is, I am. My job is not an easy one, but I really enjoy it.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: That is exactly what I wanted to talk to you about, Susan.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: What’s the problem?</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Marilyn’s career.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Well, my choice of careers.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Choice?</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: My career as a fashion designer versus my career as a mother.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Why does it have to be one or the other?</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: That’s what I said.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: How&#39;s that?</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Why can’t you do both?</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: She’s right.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Both?</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Well, that’s what I do. I have a job, and I have Michelle. I take care of both to the best of my ability. It’s not easy, but what is?</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: And that’s what I did. I did both with Richard and Susan, and I did both with Robbie.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: I thought you stayed home with Robbie?</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: I did. But I was lucky enough to have a career as a music teacher, which I could continue at home.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Why can’t you work at home, Marilyn? You’re very talented. Designing dresses is a career you could establish from home, couldn’t you?</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: I don’t know why I didn’t think of it. It seems so simple now. For a year or two, I could stay at home with Max and do my dress designs.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: And you could make your dresses at home.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Sounds like a great way to solve the problem.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: That could solve your problem, Marilyn.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: I’m going to call Rita Mae at home and ask her to come by and talk about it. She wants to see Max anyway.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: I think that really answers your questions, Marilyn. You can do it. Do your designs at home—here.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: And let Rita Mae do the selling at the boutique.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: And you can both benefit financially.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: I’m going to call Rita Mae right now. Oh, Susan, thank you so much for coming all this way from the city to talk to me about it. I hope you don’t mind having taken so much time away from your busy schedule.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Are you kidding? I don’t mind at all. As a matter of fact, I came to spend some time with my favorite nephew.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: I think you should call Rita Mae right now. I think your idea of working at home is perfect.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: I don’t know what I would do without you. I’m lucky to have you all.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: We are lucky to have you, Marilyn.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: And so is Max.</p><h2 id="act-3" tabindex="-1">Act 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#act-3" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Act 3&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Hi, big guy.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: That must be Rita Mae.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: She sure got here quickly. That&#39;s a good sign. She must like you and your work, Marilyn.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: I think she&#39;s just anxious to see Max. She loves children.</p><p><strong>Rita Mae</strong>: Hi, Marilyn.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Welcome. It&#39;s so nice of you to come.</p><p><strong>Rita Mae</strong>: Oh, I just wanted to see your baby, Max.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Hello, Rita Mae.</p><p><strong>Rita Mae</strong>: I haven&#39;t seen you since the hospital.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: I&#39;m Ellen Stewart, Marilyn&#39;s mother-in-law.</p><p><strong>Rita Mae</strong>: We met at the hospital. Hello. How are you?</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: I remember. How are you?</p><p><strong>Rita Mae</strong>: Oh, and there is Max! Oh! My, how he&#39;s grown! A little present for Max.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Oh, it&#39;s beautiful, Rita Mae! You shouldn&#39;t have.</p><p><strong>Rita Mae</strong>: It&#39;s nothing. It&#39;s just a little present for Max.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Can I get you some coffee, tea, or a cold drink, Rita Mae?</p><p><strong>Rita Mae</strong>: Oh, nothing, thank you.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Well, I will leave you two to talk. Come on, you big guy. Yes, come on. That&#39;s it.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: It&#39;s nice seeing you. Let me know if you need anything.</p><p><strong>Rita Mae</strong>: Thanks, Ellen.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Thanks, Ellen.</p><p><strong>Rita Mae</strong>: OK, Marilyn. You sounded like you&#39;ve made a decision when you called me. I&#39;m all ears.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: I have made a decision, Rita Mae. I&#39;ve decided to stay at home and be a full-time mother.</p><p><strong>Rita Mae</strong>: I&#39;m disappointed, but I respect your decision. If I had a child as cute as Max, I might do the same thing.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: But I haven&#39;t finished telling you the other half of my decision.</p><p><strong>Rita Mae</strong>: The other half?</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Yes. I think I can stay at home, take care of Max, and continue my career.</p><p><strong>Rita Mae</strong>: Sounds interesting. Let me hear it.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Do you remember our talks about custom-designed dresses for the boutique?</p><p><strong>Rita Mae</strong>: I sure do.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Why can&#39;t I design dresses for you here at home? And make them here. Have the fittings here, too.</p><p><strong>Rita Mae</strong>: And I could do the selling and the pricing at the boutique.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Exactly.</p><p><strong>Rita Mae</strong>: Oh! What kind of dresses would you design?</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: I&#39;ve thought about that for some time.</p><p><strong>Rita Mae</strong>: Yes?</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Wedding dresses.</p><p><strong>Rita Mae</strong>: Wedding dresses? Brilliant idea! There&#39;s a big market today for wedding dresses.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: That&#39;s what I thought.</p><p><strong>Rita Mae</strong>: I like the idea very much. And if it&#39;s successful, we can expand to all kinds of dresses.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: That&#39;s what I thought.</p><p><strong>Rita Mae</strong>: As a matter of fact, I have a customer for your first wedding dress. My niece is getting married, and I&#39;ve been trying to find just the right thing for her. Marilyn, you&#39;re going to design my niece&#39;s dress. That&#39;ll be our first one, and then we&#39;ll use it to sell others.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Do you really mean it?</p><p><strong>Rita Mae</strong>: I really mean it. It&#39;s a simple idea, and it will work. You can certainly design dresses. I know that. And there&#39;s no reason why you can&#39;t do it from your home.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: I&#39;m so excited! I can&#39;t wait to tell Richard!</p><p><strong>Rita Mae</strong>: If I had a baby like Max, I&#39;d want to stay home and be near him all the time, too. You&#39;re making the right decision for Max and for yourself, too, Marilyn.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: It all sounds so easy.</p><p><strong>Rita Mae</strong>: Now the hard work begins.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Would you like to see some of my designs that I&#39;ve been working on?</p><p><strong>Rita Mae</strong>: I&#39;d love to. Ooh! Oh, that&#39;s wonderful! Ooh...</p>',137),s=[r];function i(l,h,g,p,d,u){return o(),e("div",null,s)}const m=t(a,[["render",i]]);export{c as __pageData,m as default};
