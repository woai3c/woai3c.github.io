All right.</p><p>Just scooch down a few inches and I’ll grab you.</p><p>No. You’ll drop me.</p><p>I’m not gonna drop you.</p><p>I might strangle youfor climbing up here in the first place.

So happy to see you.</p><p>It’s a shame that Allison couldn’t make it.</p><p>Just another business trip for the wandering salesman.</p><p>She’d be bored to tears. Hey, Parker!</p><p>Aren’t you gonna give me a hug? It’s grandpa!</p><p>Don’t take it personnally. He’s too scared to climb down.</p><p>Can I give it a shot? Yeah, sure. Knock yourself out.</p><p>Yeah. Be careful.</p><p>Parker, I got a question for you.</p><p>It’s only one of this kind of important question.</p><p>A character-defining question actually. You wanna hear it?</p><p>Only a girl would be afraid to come down the ladder.</p><p>Now, you’re not a little girl, are you?</p><p>I’m not looking at a little girlie-girl, am I?</p><p>Are you ok? Come on.</p><p>You got him down.</p><p>How’d he do that? Sexism.</p><p>Let’s start off with addressing the division of assets.</p><p>We’re not prepared to discuss theprimary residence at this time.</p><p>Are you prepared to discuss cars? Antiques?</p><p>I’d like to discuss country club membership.</p><p>Access to the facilities is integral to Dr Van de Camp...</p><p>What are we doing here?</p><p>I’m sorry, Rex?</p><p>I’m talking to my wife.</p><p>Surrounded by lawyers dividing up our stuff.</p><p>I don’t want this. I thought I did, but I don’t.</p><p>Maybe we should talk this over before it’s too late.</p><p>What do you say, Bree?</p><p>Should we send the vultures home?</p><p>I wanna keep the club membership.</p><p>Rex is terrible at tennis.</p><p>And he hates buffets.</p><p>Ok. If you turn to page two of the proposed settlement,you’ll find our prioritized list.</p><p>Right.</p><p>They were kissing, huh? Right at my kitchen table.</p><p>You must have shocked the hell out of ’em.</p><p>I’m glad you can laugh about this. They’re being kids.</p><p>This is easy for you.</p><p>You’re the father of the boy. I’m the mother of the girl.</p><p>If things get out of hand...</p><p>What is it you want from me?</p><p>Well, I want to know that I am not the only onewho’s worried about this.</p><p>And I want to know that if the two of them are over here,they are gonna be supervised.</p><p>And I really want you to stop looking at me like I’m crazy.</p><p>The only reason I’m smiling is becauseit’s practically irrelevant.</p><p>I’ve sold the house.</p><p>Really?</p><p>We’ll be moving at the end of the month.</p><p>You sold the house?</p><p>Zach... Why didn’t you tell me about this?</p><p>I wanted to wait till it was official.</p><p>You told me when I got back from Silvercrestthat you’d reconsider. You lied to me.</p><p>I think you need to take your medicine.</p><p>You think pumping me full of drugs is gonna keep me quiet?</p><p>Upstairs! Now! You don’t care about me!</p><p>You didn’t care about mom!</p><p>You know what? I wish she’d shot you instead.</p><p>So you’re moving.</p><p>We’re all gonna miss you.</p><p>In the future, checklist means ”is it in the car?”not like, ”do you remember it”.</p><p>The next morning, before Parker Scavo’s little league gamehad even begun...</p><p>Hurry! I’m not the one that forgot my mitt.</p><p>...A major player was about to be tagged out.</p><p>I...I thought you guys were at... at practice.</p><p>Oh, Parker, um, forgot his catcher’s mitt.</p><p>Ah... Lynette, this is Lois Mcdaniel.</p><p>She’s one of my major suppliers in the area.</p><p>She’s in paper products manufacturing.</p><p>Uh, it’s nice to meet you.</p><p>Nice to meet you. You have a lovely home.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Just working out, uh, some of these new contracts.</p><p>Hammering out some of the little things, the minor details.</p><p>Overhead, shipping costs...</p><p>Mommy, look what I found.</p><p>I’m sorry. These are mine.</p><p>Thank you. They must have fallen out of my purse.</p><p>Well, we don’t want to be late for the game.</p><p>Nice to meet you.</p><p>I’m not speaking to you.</p><p>Didn’t like the settlement talks?</p><p>You only demanded the good chinabecause you know I love it.</p><p>You take our timeshare in Aspenand I’m vindictive?</p><p>You’ll hardly ever use that place.</p><p>Hardly? How about never?</p><p>Fine. When I move out,I’m gonna use your good chinafor takeout food. Yeah pizza, spare ribs.</p><p>You know what, at our next settlement talks,I plan on asking for your golf clubs.</p><p>Isn’t divorce fun?</p><p>It’s time for your heart medication.</p><p>You know I meant what I said at that meeting.</p><p>I will fire my lawyer tomorrow.</p><p>Just give me the word. Sweetie, I think it’s too late.</p><p>Why? Because you were unfaithful.</p><p>But if you could find a way to forgive me,If we could find the way to be happy,wouldn’t you want that?</p><p>You know what I really, truly want? Revenge.</p><p>I mean, if somehow we could level the playing field,then, um, maybe I could find a way to come back.</p><p>So what does that mean? You want to have an affair?</p><p>Ok. Uh, so who are we talking about here?</p><p>Your dopey pharmacist?</p><p>Would that hurt you, Rex?</p><p>If I slept with another man?</p><p>It would devastate me.</p><p>Here you go. Bree, you... you can’t possibly...</p><p>Rex. Time to take your medicine.</p><p>I got it!</p><p>She doesn’t hate you. My mom just worries.</p><p>She thinks I’m crazy. No, she doesn’t.</p><p>Well, maybe a little.</p><p>You didn’t tell her what I told you, did you?</p><p>About what happened to Dana?</p><p>Zach, I can keep a secret.</p><p>I promise I will never tell her.</p><p>What’s that noise?</p><p>Hi. What... what are you doing here?</p><p>I was walking outside and I saw you in the window.</p><p>I was surprised. I never thought of you as a diner person.</p><p>I’m not. The coffee’s just dreadful.</p><p>Well, it’s late and I needed to get out of the house,and it was the only place still open.</p><p>I didn’t mean to interrupt.</p><p>George?</p><p>Would you like to join me for a dreadful cup of coffee?</p><p>It was my first week in college and I went to a...</p><p>a meeting of the young republicanswhere Rex gave a speech.</p><p>And I went up to him afterward and introduced myself,told him I agreed with his stance on the death penalty.</p><p>He took me out to a diner and, uh...</p><p>We stayed up ’til two in the morning,talking about big government,gun control, and illegal immigration.</p><p>Uh, it was just... It was just such a magical night.</p><p>And I knew by the time he got me back to my dorm,that one day I was gonna be Mrs. Rex van de kamp.</p><p>And even now, after the betrayal,I know that we’re supposed to be together.</p><p>But I don’t know how I can be withsomeone I don’t trust.</p><p>So, what are you gonna do?</p><p>That I don’t know.</p><p>What do you think I should do?</p><p>You’re asking me? I should not have done that. I am...</p><p>No, it’s ok.</p><p>No, it’s not ok.</p><p>George, it was insensitive.</p><p>I know how you feel about me, and I...</p><p>Bree, I want to help.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>So, does he love you? Yes.</p><p>Is he a good person?</p><p>Aside from the adultery, yes.</p><p>Well, then it’s easy.</p><p>If I could get a good person to love me,I would find a way to forgive them.</p><p>You are such a special man, George Williams.</p><p>And you deserve such a special woman.</p><p>I think so.</p><p>Where are you going?</p><p>I thought I’d eat this in my room.</p><p>The house isn’t that big, Rodney.</p><p>You’re gonna have to stop avoiding me.</p><p>Ok, ok. Lois isn’t a supplier.</p><p>Really?</p><p>Yeah, and I want to apologize.</p><p>I... I thought you and the kids were gonna be gone all afternoon.</p><p>Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?</p><p>Well, for start is that you can wipethat disgusting smirk off your face.</p><p>Lynette...</p><p>How could you do this to Allison?</p><p>I don’t know. It happens a little bit at a time.</p><p>Years go by, the kids burn you out,I’m on the road so much,we just drifted apart. It’s complicated.</p><p>It’s not complicated. It’s completely irresponsible.</p><p>For years, I have stayed married to a woman I don’t love,because I made a vow to god.</p><p>So don’t talk to me about responsibilities.</p><p>So you take on this that you’re the victim?</p><p>I can see that we’re just going to have to agree to disagree.</p><p>We’re not done here.</p><p>Yeah, we are. ’cause my sex lifeis my own business, not yours.</p><p>And there’s nothing you can do about it, anyway.</p><p>Dad? What are you doing? I don’t want to talk about it.</p><p>Talk about what, does Lynette know you’re out here?</p><p>Oh, yeah. She knows.</p><p>Can you drive me to the airport? Wait here.</p><p>Lynette? yeah?</p><p>Why is my dad sitting out on the curb?</p><p>Because I kicked him out of the house.</p><p>I... I see. You wanna tell me why?</p><p>Hold on. I made you a drink.</p><p>Oh, god, what did he do?</p><p>Yesterday I came home and I walkedin on your dad with a woman.</p><p>He’s having an affair. I am so, so sorry.</p><p>God... I know. I know. Are you ok?</p><p>Yeah. Um, I should go talk to him.</p><p>That’s it? What?</p><p>I just...I expected a bigger reaction.</p><p>I’ve been sitting with knots in my stomach.</p><p>Ok, I never mentioned thisbecause I knew how you’d react. But, um...</p><p>I’m not that surprised by this.</p><p>My father’s been having affairs for years.</p><p>You knew about this? Yeah. Kinda. Yeah.</p><p>I mean it was mostly in the past.</p><p>I didn’t know that he was still at it.</p><p>I figured he was too old.</p><p>In some strange way, I’m impressed.</p><p>Impressed? Impressed? I...</p><p>Tom, Please, please don’t tell me you’re all right with this.</p><p>I’m not. No, no. He should never have brought her here.</p><p>No. He shouldn’t have been with her at all!</p><p>I know. I know. But, you know, that’s who he is.</p><p>I mean. It’s been going on for years. My mom’s made peace with it.</p><p>I seriously doubt that.</p><p>Look, you know, there’s no point talking about this.</p><p>I’m gonna go get my father.</p><p>I’m gonna bring him back and I’m gonna put him in his room.</p><p>And we can all cool off.</p><p>No. He is not coming back in this house.</p><p>Yes, he is. No, he’s not.</p><p>Lynette. He is my father, this is my house.</p><p>You can’t tell me what to do.</p><p>I say we kick the door down.</p><p>Yeah, Dad, you do that.</p><p>Let me know how that works out for you.</p><p>I don’t know if I have the right address.</p><p>Does John Rowland live here?</p><p>I’m really glad you came by.</p><p>I was gonna call you again tomorrow.</p><p>Uh, yeah. I’m sorry I haven’t returned any of your calls.</p><p>It’s ok. I’m just happy to see you.</p><p>I heard about Mr. Solis.</p><p>It sucks you had to take a job.</p><p>Yeah. Well, you know me. I’ll survive.</p><p>Come here.</p><p>Oh, no... John... I didn’t come here for that.</p><p>What’s wrong?</p><p>Well. I heard you’re going full-time with your gardening business.</p><p>What happened to college?</p><p>I decided not to go. Why?</p><p>Well, an opportunity has presented itself,and for me to take advantage of it,I need to start making money.</p><p>John, what opportunity is more important than college?</p><p>For the longest time, the only thing I had to offer you was my heart.</p><p>Mr. Solis gave you security and I couldn’t compete.</p><p>But now he can’t offer you that.</p><p>And I can.</p><p>My business is taking off.</p><p>I can take care of you. We can finally be together.</p><p>Mrs. Solis,will you marry me?</p><p>Please. Why also do you want to chaperone the dance?</p><p>Mrs. Van de kamp needed volunteers. She begged me.</p><p>You’re so transparent.</p><p>Anyway, you won’t even know I’m there.</p><p>Well, not too much.</p><p>Julie. You know you can tell me anything. right?</p><p>Yeah, Mom.</p><p>So if you had a problem,or some sort of secret was weighing on you...?</p><p>Of course. I tell you everything.</p><p>I can’t believe you’re just uprooting us like this.</p><p>We need a fresh start.</p><p>Here. You wanna get it about like this.</p><p>So many bad things have happened around here.</p><p>And finally I have someone I can talk toand you want to take that away.</p><p>You mean Julie? Yeah.</p><p>What bad things do you talk to her about?</p><p>Do you talk about your mother? Yeah... And other stuff.</p><p>Like what?</p><p>Zach. Like what?</p><p>Dad, this is what I’ve been trying to talk to you about.</p><p>Ever since mom died, I’ve, I’ve started to remember things.</p><p>Just quick flashes from when I was little.</p><p>Nice and taut, like this.</p><p>What kind of things?</p><p>Lots of blood. Mom screaming.</p><p>And Dana.</p><p>I remember killing Dana.</p><p>You... Told this to Julie?</p><p>I trust her.</p><p>Did she tell her mother?</p><p>I don’t know.</p><p>Start from the beginning.</p><p>I want you to tell me everything that you told Julie.</p><p>What’s that?</p><p>Oh, well, I was going to give it to you,but I saw the other girls weren’t wearing flowers.</p><p>I guess it’s not that kind of dance.</p><p>If you don’t want to stand out, I’d understand.</p><p>I like standing out.</p><p>What’s Paul doing here?</p><p>Oh, he’s chaperoning. He called a couple of hours ago and volunteered.</p><p>Really? Why? What’s wrong?</p><p>The other day, he couldn’t have cared less about Julie and Zach dating.</p><p>And now all of a sudden he shows up at the dance?</p><p>Maybe he’s trying to be supportive.</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>Dr. Van de kamp.</p><p>Hello. Geogre. My cardiologist just phoned in a prescription.</p><p>Oh, right, right. I’ve got it here somewhere.</p><p>So, have you seen Bree lately?</p><p>Yeah. I ran into her last night on Maple Avenue.</p><p>We had a nice talk.</p><p>That’s all you did? Just talked?</p><p>We’re just friends. Dr. Van de kamp. Nothing more.</p><p>That’s good to hear.</p><p>You know if you ever do get a vibe from Bree,that she’s interested in more than just friendship.</p><p>I’d be careful if I were you.</p><p>Excuse me?</p><p>I just want you to know that she’d onlybe using you to even the score with me.</p><p>Don’t fall for it.</p><p>Bree would never do anything like that. She’s a lady.</p><p>Exactly. A very beautiful, classy lady.</p><p>Remember, they tend to end up with doctors.</p><p>Not pharmacists.</p><p>Bree is very beautiful. And very classy.</p><p>But she’s not very perceptive.</p><p>For instance, she thinks you’re a good person.</p><p>And it’s now very clear to me, you aren’t.</p><p>I’d like my prescription now, George.</p><p>I can’t seem to find it.</p><p>I guess I’ll have to have it delivered.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>No, thank you.</p><p>Paul.</p><p>Did you notice they’re playing a classic?</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>Care to dance?</p><p>I’d love to.</p><p>I have a little confession to make.</p><p>I’ve been so concerned about Julie lately,that I sort of eavesdropped on her the other day,while she was having a phone conversation with Zach.</p><p>Really?</p><p>They were having an interesting conversation.</p><p>About?</p><p>Zach was telling Julie about what happened to Dana.</p><p>Was he now? Yes.</p><p>How much did you hear? Everything.</p><p>You realize it was an accident.</p><p>Oh, of course. I assumed as much.</p><p>He didn’t mean to kill Dana.</p><p>He was practically a baby himself.</p><p>He didn’t understand what he was doing.</p><p>No, of course he didn’t.</p><p>So... What happened exactly?</p><p>Mary Alice and I never really knew.</p><p>We heard the baby screaming.</p><p>When we got up to the crib, it was too late.</p><p>Paul, I am so sorry.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>So you and Mary Alice just keptthis to yourselves all these years?</p><p>It was a very dark chapter in our lives.</p><p>We preferred not to relive it.</p><p>It was also a private family matter.</p><p>I’d appreciate your discretion.</p><p>Sure.</p><p>Did you have a good time? Yeah, I did.</p><p>It was great.</p><p>Look, I want you to know that I’m really sorry I talked to Julie.</p><p>But she promised not to say anything to her mom.</p><p>It’s ok. I handled Susan.</p><p>Good.</p><p>But we need to talk about thesethings that you think you remember.</p><p>They’re not true.</p><p>How can they not be true?</p><p>Memories lie, Zach.</p><p>You didn’t kill anyone.</p><p>Dana is very much alive.</p><p>Hi. What are you doing here? Where is it?</p><p>What? The ring. My grandmother’s ring.</p><p>John caught me off guard.</p><p>I’m going to give back the ring.</p><p>Well, you’d better.</p><p>Because make no mistake, if you try to ruin my son’s life,I will ruin yours.</p><p>Helen! Ok, go to the car. Come on, please. Just... Please.</p><p>Obviously, I’m not leaving my husband and marrying John.</p><p>I think that’s wise.</p><p>I’ll talk to John tomorrow and give back the ring.</p><p>Good, good. Um... We appreciate everything you’ve done.</p><p>Hey, Bob, I get why she’s so angry with me.</p><p>But what I don’t get is why you’re so nice.</p><p>Well, John’s a big boy.</p><p>Whatever happened between the two of youwas his mistake as much as yours.</p><p>I guess. I understand if, uh,if you hate me just a little.</p><p>When I was a kid, I always played by the rules.</p><p>I never cheated on a test.</p><p>Never even missed a curfew.</p><p>But I can’t help but think how wonderful it would have beento have made at least one mistake like you.</p><p>That’s... sweet. You... You’re very sweet.</p><p>Well, I’m a little sweet.</p><p>Mostly I’m just middle-aged.</p><p>Are you ok?</p><p>I know this is a lot to digest all at once.</p><p>I’m fine. I’m just happy you finally told me the truth.</p><p>One thing, though. Why are you telling me all this now?</p><p>I couldn’t let you think you killed someone.</p><p>No one should carry that kind of burden.</p><p>You didn’t want me running my mouth.</p><p>That’s not what it’s about.</p><p>Yes, it is.</p><p>I won’t tell anyone. I’ll keep your secret.</p><p>Dad? Thank you.</p><p>But we’re not moving.</p><p>That’s out of the question.</p><p>I’m not leaving Julie.</p><p>And if you want my support, that’s the deal.</p><p>And if I refuse? You won’t.</p><p>So here’s the thing. I feel really awful about how I acted before.</p><p>You threw me out of my own house.</p><p>I overreacted. I know. I’m sorry.</p><p>Look, I know you love my mom.</p><p>But how she decides to live her life is just...</p><p>It’s entirely up to her.</p><p>You’re right. You’re right.</p><p>I guess i just got so upset because...</p><p>Oh, whatever. Let’s not beat a dead horse.</p><p>It’s over. I’m sorry. Good night.</p><p>Ok. Get it off your chest.</p><p>You knew he was having a affair and it didn’t bother you.</p><p>And that worries me because if you can condone something like that,then what’s gonna happen when you’ve been on the road for 40 years?</p><p>Lynette, I’m not my father.</p><p>I know. Of course. You’re not your father.</p><p>And just so we’re absolutely clear,I am definitely not your mother.</p><p>Because if you ever betray me, I will leave you.</p><p>I will take the kids, and you will never see any of us again.</p><p>Glad to get that off my chest. Thank you. I love you.</p><p>Couldn’t sleep, huh? No.</p><p>Me either.</p><p>I’m sorry about the ruckus I caused.</p><p>It’s ok. I’m not... I’m not upset about that.</p><p>No?
