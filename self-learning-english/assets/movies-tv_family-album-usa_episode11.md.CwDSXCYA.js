Philip and I were living with Grandma and Grandpa. Philip was a young doctor, and he kept talking about having a house of our own. It&#39;s natural.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: What did you do?</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: We looked at a lot of houses.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Did you find one?</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Oh, not at first. We couldn&#39;t afford it. Grandpa wanted to lend us the money to buy one, but Philip is too independent. He didn&#39;t want to borrow any money.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Sounds like Richard.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: They&#39;re all alike. Richard is a real Stewart. He&#39;s independent, and sometimes just stubborn.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: When did you buy a house?</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: After Richard was born. I was teaching music, and Philip was opening his first medical office.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Where was the house?</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Right here in Riverdale. Of course, it was a small house, but just right for us.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: It&#39;s funny. History repeats itself. Now Richard and I are having a baby, and we probably won&#39;t be able to afford a house right away, either.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Why don&#39;t you look at some houses, Marilyn?</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Good idea.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Look in the real-estate section of Sunday&#39;s Times. You&#39;ll learn a lot.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Maybe we should speak to a real-estate agent about a house.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: And a bank about a mortgage.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: I&#39;ll talk to Richard about it. I think it&#39;s a good idea, Ellen. We can learn a lot by asking.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: And if I can be of any help, let me know. As a matter of fact, my friend Virginia Martinelli is a real-estate agent.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Good.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: You won&#39;t believe this, but she sold us our first house and this one.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Well, I&#39;ll tell Richard, and we&#39;ll go to see her. Do you think the skirt length is right, Ellen? Do you think it&#39;s too long?</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: I think the skirt is just right. Are you planning to attach a train to it?</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: No. No train. Just the dress. But I am going to make a headpiece of lace.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: That dress is gorgeous.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Thanks, Ellen. And thanks for the advice about the house. I&#39;ll talk to Richard about it the minute he comes home.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: And remember, we love having you here. There&#39;s no need to rush.</p><h2 id="act-2" tabindex="-1">Act 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#act-2" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Act 2&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Virginia</strong>: I remember your parents&#39; first house very well. It was on Spring Avenue, near the park.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: I grew up in that house.</p><p><strong>Virginia</strong>: Yes, and you were such a cute baby.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: I&#39;ve seen pictures of him. He had blond hair.</p><p><strong>Virginia</strong>: I&#39;ve been friendly with the Stewart family for a long time, so it&#39;s my pleasure to help you find a house now.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Well, we&#39;re not sure we can afford one.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: But we&#39;d like to find out about the possibilities.</p><p><strong>Virginia</strong>: That&#39;s a good idea. I love your house on Linden Street. I sold your father that house seventeen years ago.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Really?</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Yes, Mom was pregnant with Robbie then, and they needed the extra room.</p><p><strong>Virginia</strong>: I hear you&#39;re expecting a baby, Mrs. Stewart.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Mmm-hmm. So we will be needing more room.</p><p><strong>Virginia</strong>: Oh, so you don&#39;t need something immediately?</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: No. But in five or six months...</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: And time passes so quickly.</p><p><strong>Virginia</strong>: Yes, it does. Well, when you called, you gave me enough information about your salaries and your savings. So I have a good idea about your financial situation. Let me show you some pictures of houses.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: With two bedrooms?</p><p><strong>Virginia</strong>: Yes, I think I can show you some. Of course, they won&#39;t be in Riverdale. The cost of housing&#39;s too high for you here.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: I haven&#39;t thought about living anywhere else. We&#39;ve always lived in this area.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Where should we look for a house, Mrs. Martinelli?</p><p><strong>Virginia</strong>: Well, we have an office in Mount Kisco. It&#39;s a lovely area, and it&#39;s only about an hour&#39;s drive from here. Here. I have a book with photos of some homes in that area. Now, let&#39;s see. Here. This is a lovely two-bedroom house in your price range.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: It&#39;s pretty, but I prefer a two-story home.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: I do, too. I don&#39;t care for a ranch type.</p><p><strong>Virginia</strong>: OK. Oh, this is a wonderful house. I know it well. I sold it to the present owners.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: It looks wonderful.</p><p><strong>Virginia</strong>: This is a two-bedroom, two-bath house. It has a full basement, and it is on a half-acre lot. You can probably afford this one.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: I like this house.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: So do I.</p><p><strong>Virginia</strong>: And the price is right. Would you like to go see it?</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Yes. We&#39;re planning to talk to someone at the bank next week. Perhaps we could see the house this weekend.</p><p><strong>Virginia</strong>: If someone doesn&#39;t buy it before then. But let&#39;s keep looking. Just to get an idea of some other possibilities.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: This is very helpful, Mrs. Martinelli.</p><p><strong>Virginia</strong>: Here. This is a wonderful example of Spanish-style architecture.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Oh, I love the roof tiles on a Spanish-style house.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: It looks like the houses in Hollywood.</p><p><strong>Virginia</strong>: It&#39;s interesting. A house like this in Riverdale costs double the price. Oh my! Here&#39;s a real buy. It&#39;s a bargain. This house just came on the market.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: It&#39;s quite lovely. Is it a two-bedroom house?</p><p><strong>Virginia</strong>: No. It has three bedrooms and three baths. I know the house. It has a brand new kitchen. And a living room with a twelve-foot ceiling. And there&#39;s a two-car garage.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Then why don&#39;t we go look at this house, too?</p><p><strong>Virginia</strong>: It&#39;s a good investment.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Thank you, Mrs. Martinelli.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Thanks so much.</p><p><strong>Virginia</strong>: My pleasure. Give my best to your parents.</p><p><strong>Virginia</strong>: Your father&#39;s a wonderful doctor, Richard. He took care of my daughter when she was a child. He&#39;s the best pediatrician in Westchester.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Thanks, Mrs. Martinelli, I&#39;ll give them your regards.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: We really appreciate your advice.</p><p><strong>Virginia</strong>: I do think you should go see the houses and talk to the bank. Here. Let me give you some information sheets about the houses. They&#39;re both very good buys.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Well, thanks so much for your help and your time, Mrs. Martinelli. We&#39;ve got a lot to talk about.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Mmm-hmm. Thanks.</p><h2 id="act-3" tabindex="-1">Act 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#act-3" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Act 3&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Mr</strong>. Riley: How do you do?</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Hello.</p><p><strong>Mr</strong>. Riley: I&#39;m Ralph Riley.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: I&#39;m Richard Stewart, and this is my wife, Marilyn.</p><p><strong>Mr</strong>. Riley: Pleased to meet you.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Likewise, Mr. Riley.</p><p><strong>Mr</strong>. Riley: Please, sit down. What can I do for you?</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: We&#39;d like to discuss a mortgage.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: For a house.</p><p><strong>Mr</strong>. Riley: Fine. Are you buying a house or are you refinancing your present home?</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: We&#39;re planning to buy a house.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: And we&#39;d like to find out about a mortgage.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: We are customers of the bank. As a matter of fact, my whole family banks here.</p><p><strong>Mr</strong>. Riley: I have some questions to ask. Do you own your house or do you rent?</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Neither. We live with my parents, Dr. and Mrs. Philip Stewart.</p><p><strong>Mr</strong>. Riley: And how old are you?</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: I&#39;m twenty-nine.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: I&#39;m thirty.</p><p><strong>Mr</strong>. Riley: And, Mr. Stewart, what is your occupation?</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: I&#39;m a freelance photographer.</p><p><strong>Mr</strong>. Riley: And, Mrs. Stewart, are you working?</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Yes. I&#39;m a designer, and I work in a boutique.</p><p><strong>Mr</strong>. Riley: Did you bring any savings or salary information? Last year&#39;s tax forms?</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Yes. Here they are.</p><p><strong>Mr</strong>. Riley: OK. What...what kind of house did you have in mind?</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: We&#39;re talking about buying a two-bedroom house in Mount Kisco. Here are the financial details on the house.</p><p><strong>Mr</strong>. Riley: Thank you. Are you prepared to make a ten-percent down payment?</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Yes, we are.</p><p><strong>Mr</strong>. Riley: Payments over thirty years?</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Yes.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Do you think we can get a loan?</p><p><strong>Mr</strong>. Riley: Well, it depends. Do you own any other property? Any stocks or bonds?</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: No.</p><p><strong>Mr</strong>. Riley: I see. Then you don&#39;t have any collateral. Perhaps you could get a guarantor—someone to sign for the loan for you.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Why is that necessary?</p><p><strong>Mr</strong>. Riley: Since you don&#39;t have enough income, and you don&#39;t already own any property, the bank needs to be sure you can pay the mortgage every month. A guarantor is responsible for the loan if you can&#39;t make the payments.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: I see. Well, the idea of buying a house is exciting.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Thank you, Mr. Riley. We&#39;ll read this over carefully.</p><p><strong>Mr</strong>. Riley: Thank you.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Good-bye. Thanks.</p><p><strong>Mr</strong>. Riley: Good-bye. And hope to see you soon.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: I hope so, too.</p><p><strong>Mr</strong>. Riley: Take care.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Good-bye.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: It all sounded so easy until they mentioned needing collateral or a guarantor.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: We have no collateral.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: And I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to ask Dad to sign as a guarantor. I don&#39;t feel right about it.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: I understand your feelings about it, Richard.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Now, tell me, what&#39;s the problem?</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: We can get a loan from the bank if we can put up some collateral.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: And we don&#39;t own anything to use as collateral.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Or someone can sign with us as a guarantor.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Why don&#39;t you speak to Dad?</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: No. If we buy a house, I want to be able to handle it alone.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Everybody needs help sometimes, Richard.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: I understand Richard&#39;s feelings about it, Ellen.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: In two or three months, I&#39;ll have an advance on my book and be able to put more money down.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: What about the house in Mount Kisco? Somebody else&#39;ll buy it by then.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Then there&#39;ll be other houses, Marilyn.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Richard has a point. You&#39;re just beginning to look.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: We&#39;re in no great rush. It&#39;s true.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: This has been a great learning experience for us, Marilyn. Talking to the real-estate agent. Looking at the houses. Talking to the loan officer at the bank.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: It has been a learning experience. That&#39;s true.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: I think you&#39;re doing the right thing. Taking your time. Looking around. Especially with a purchase of this kind. You&#39;re talking about a lot of money.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: We&#39;ll call Mrs. Martinelli and tell her to keep looking for us.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: And I&#39;ll call Mr. Riley at the bank and tell him we&#39;ll see him in a couple of months.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: And if you ever need Dad or me to help you...</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: We know.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: You know we&#39;ll be there for you.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: It&#39;s a Stewart tradition.
