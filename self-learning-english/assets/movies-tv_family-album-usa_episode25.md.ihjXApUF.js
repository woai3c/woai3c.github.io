I love hot dogs. There is nothing better than a hot dog in the country.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Hot dogs and mustard.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Cooked outdoors over an open fire. I wish I had one now.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Do you remember when Daddy and I used to take you and Susan and Robbie to Jones Beach?</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Oh, I sure do.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: We&#39;d wait until dark and make a fire, and we&#39;d cook the hot dogs. Oh, don&#39;t forget the mustard. And, oh, does anybody want ketchup?</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: I might as well take it along. And now to make sure we&#39;ve got the hamburger patties. I have to remember to put them in the bag tomorrow morning before we leave.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: I&#39;ll remind you, Richard.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Mom, we really appreciate your taking care of Max for the weekend and giving up your free time.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: I love doing it. Susan and Harry have a sitter for Michelle in the city, and I&#39;m taking care of Max. It&#39;s no big deal. I am happy to do it for you.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: I guess Max is asleep by now. He&#39;s not crying anymore.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Oh, poor baby. He&#39;s teething.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Well, he&#39;s asleep—finally. I feel so bad for him. It hurts so much when a baby gets his first teeth.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: He&#39;ll be fine, Marilyn.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Well, he wakes up several times during the night, and the pain is so bad.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: I&#39;m really concerned about going away for the weekend, Ellen, and leaving you with the full responsibility of taking care of Max. Especially with his teething. I wish he felt better.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Please don&#39;t worry, Marilyn. Remember your father-in-law&#39;s a pediatrician. We have a live-in doctor if there&#39;s a problem I can&#39;t handle.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: I agree, Marilyn. We really don&#39;t have to be overly concerned.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: I&#39;ll go upstairs and stay with him until he falls asleep again.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Thanks, Richard. Try putting him across your lap on his stomach. He likes that.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: I&#39;ll try it.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: When are Susan and Harry picking you up, Marilyn?</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: They&#39;re coming by at six tomorrow morning, so we can get an early start.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: That&#39;s nice. And you&#39;ll have a full day in the country.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: And a full night. Tomorrow night we&#39;ll be camping out in tents.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: And coming home on Sunday?</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: We&#39;ll be heading back late in the afternoon.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: You&#39;re going to have the time of your lives. Camping out is such great fun.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: We&#39;ll have a great time camping out, I&#39;m sure. But I&#39;m still a little worried about you, Ellen.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: It will be my great pleasure, Marilyn. Remember, it&#39;s only one night.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: He&#39;s asleep. I think he&#39;ll sleep through the night now.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Thanks, honey. I hope he&#39;s good when we&#39;re away.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Well, so do I. Now, to check the list of things we need for the camping trip. We need to bring a flashlight.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: It&#39;s in the right-hand drawer, next to the bottle openers.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Do we have a bottle opener on the list, Marilyn?</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: No. No bottle opener. Is that one of the things Susan and Harry are bringing?</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: No. And we&#39;re bringing the ketchup, mustard, relish—all that stuff. And cooking utensils. Well, here&#39;s the bottle opener, and here&#39;s the flashlight.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Matches.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Matches?</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Yes, of course. For when we build our campfire. I can&#39;t build a fire by rubbing two pieces of wood together.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: And don&#39;t forget your camera and film, Richard.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: All packed and ready.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: And let&#39;s not forget our cassette player and some tapes. Some music tapes and some blank tapes so that we can record our thoughts about the trip.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Oh, that&#39;s a nice idea. An audio diary.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: That&#39;s what I thought.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Got it! The cassette player and the tapes.</p><h2 id="act-2" tabindex="-1">Act 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#act-2" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Act 2&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Oh, I love it! To be away from the city on such a beautiful day is my idea of heaven! The grass. The trees. The fresh air.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: I told you you&#39;d like it. I&#39;ve been doing this for years.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: You have the spirit of a teenager, Susan. Wait till you see yourself jumping around.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: That&#39;s what I love about Susan. She works hard. She plays hard. She&#39;s a real Stewart.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: Come on, Richard. Help me get this stuff out of the car.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Where does it go?</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: Well, we&#39;ll put everything over there. We&#39;ll set up our tents over there by the edge of the woods. Then we&#39;ll be able to make our fire there where it&#39;s safe.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Oh, there&#39;s our table and benches. All set for eating.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: That&#39;s what makes this spot so good.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Is anybody hungry?</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: I am.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: We just got here.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: When you&#39;re out in the fresh air like this, it makes you hungry. Aren&#39;t you hungry, Marilyn?</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: I sure am. How about you, Richard?</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Starving.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: You guys are like three kids.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Aren&#39;t you hungry, Harry?</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: Well, yeah. Now that you mention it, I guess I am. I mean, how could a guy not be hungry with all this talk about eating?</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Where&#39;s the bag with the chicken salad sandwiches?</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: Right here, next to the ice packs. Here. Put the tablecloth on the picnic table, and I will bring the cola and the plastic cups.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: Well, how do you like it so far?</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: I&#39;ve never been more relaxed.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Me, neither.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: I wish we had brought Michelle, Harry. She would have loved it.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Oh, you&#39;re right. I wish we had brought Max.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Marilyn, Susan, let&#39;s not begin to worry about Michelle and Max. We&#39;re having a good time, and they&#39;re in good hands.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: Richard is right. Are you having a good time, Susan? You haven&#39;t answered my question.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: I am having a good time, Harry. I promise not to think about the city. We&#39;re in the country. Let&#39;s all just enjoy this wonderful place and this wonderful weather.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: Good.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: This is heaven, Harry! It was such a great idea to spend the weekend this way.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: Thanks, Susan. I thought you&#39;d all like it.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Like it? I love it! Listen to the sounds of the summer that surround us. It&#39;s so calming.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: I&#39;ve always liked camping out. Away from the telephones and account books. It&#39;s refreshing for me. I always go back to the city in a wonderful state of mind.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: We&#39;ve only been here for a day, and I&#39;ve completely forgotten about all my business problems. The office seems so far away.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: I&#39;m glad you like it, Susan. We&#39;ll spend many more weekends like this.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: And next time we&#39;ll bring Michelle. I wish she were here with us to enjoy the country.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: And next time we&#39;ll bring Michelle.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Just listen to the sound. It&#39;s so soothing.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: I can hardly keep my eyes open. If only we could bottle the fresh air.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Wouldn&#39;t it be wonderful?</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: We could call it &quot;Deep Sleep Country Air.&quot;</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: It puts you to sleep. So does the sound. I&#39;ve been having a hard time keeping my eyes open just listening to it. It&#39;s like a special music.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Too bad we can&#39;t bottle the sound.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: But we can!</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Can what?</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Bottle the sound.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: What are you talking about?</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Oh, yeah? Great idea! Let&#39;s do it!</p><h2 id="act-3" tabindex="-1">Act 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#act-3" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Act 3&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: I&#39;m so glad everyone is asleep. I thought Max would be crying, and everybody would be awake.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: What did I tell you? Nothing to worry about.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: I&#39;m sure everything is fine. My mother knows all there is to know about taking care of babies, I assure you.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: Let&#39;s put some of this stuff away and then take off. We&#39;ve got a forty-minute drive into the city.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Welcome home—and I do mean welcome home.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Something wrong?</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Oh, nothing&#39;s wrong, Richard. Believe me, Max is fine. But his teeth hurt, and he just can&#39;t get to sleep, poor dear.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Neither can you.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Oh, I feel so bad.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Oh, I&#39;m fine. How was your weekend?</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: We had a great time, Mom.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: It was wonderful. The weather couldn&#39;t have been better.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: It was nice here, too.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Did you get a chance to get outside at all?</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Oh, yes. Grandpa helped me yesterday afternoon. I went to the supermarket to get a few things, and I stayed out an extra half hour. The village was filled with people—the weather was so nice.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Harry&#39;s a professional camper, Mom. He knows all there is to know, and he made the weekend very easy for us to enjoy.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: Come on. You all helped.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: You were wonderful, Harry!</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Why don&#39;t you go to your room, Mom, and get some sleep.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Oh, I&#39;m fine. Tell me more about your weekend. Did you do anything special?</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Lots of special country things. We picked flowers.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: And we brought some home for you. It was so nice to be out in the country.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: They smell wonderful.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Everything smelled so special. It would have been great if we had been able to bottle the smells.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: It would be a great business if you could do that.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Oh!</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Uh, we&#39;re home now, Ellen. We&#39;ll take care of it.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: I&#39;ll take care of it. Let&#39;s see if it works.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: What&#39;s that?</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: A little we&#39;d better head home. It&#39;s getting late, and we have a bit of a drive.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: Well, all your things are inside. There&#39;s your sleeping bag.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Oh, thanks, Harry.</p><p><strong>Harry</strong>: Say good-bye to Richard. We&#39;ll call you all tomorrow night.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Good-bye.</p><p><strong>Susan</strong>: Bye, Mom.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Bye-bye.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Bye.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: I&#39;m so tired I think I&#39;m overtired. I don&#39;t know if I can get to sleep.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Max has stopped crying.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Yes. It works!</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: It works!</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: What works?</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: This.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Oh. Oh, where did you get that? It sounds so nice. I think I&#39;m falling asleep.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Like Max did.</p><p><strong>Richard</strong>: Good night.</p><p><strong>Marilyn</strong>: Good night. Sounds of the country. The soothing sounds of the country.</p>',145),a=[s];function i(g,l,h,p,d,u){return o(),e("div",null,a)}const m=t(n,[["render",i]]);export{c as __pageData,m as default};
