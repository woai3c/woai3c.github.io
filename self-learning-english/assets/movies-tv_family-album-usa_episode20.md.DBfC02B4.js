She sure keeps busy.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: It&#39;s important to her. There are lots of places to go, lots of things to do. She can&#39;t sit around and do nothing. Philip works late.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: I guess you&#39;re right. I wish I had her energy.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Anybody home?</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: We&#39;re in here, Dad.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Oh. Hi, gang.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Hello, Philip. How was your day?</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: My day was just fine. So was my night. It&#39;s almost ten o&#39;clock. Mmm. I&#39;m starving. Um...where&#39;s Mom?</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: She went to a school-board meeting.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: There&#39;s a note for you on the refrigerator.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Oh?</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Did you have dinner, Robbie?</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Yeah. Mike and I had a hamburger at the diner. I came home a little while ago. You&#39;ve been working late almost every night this week, Dad. Aren&#39;t you exhausted?</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: I don&#39;t have time to be exhausted.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: You and Mom haven&#39;t had dinner together with us in almost a full week.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Yeah, I feel bad about us not having dinner with the family, but our schedules are so different. Either I&#39;m at the hospital doing paperwork, or Mom is at a committee meeting. I frankly don&#39;t know what to do about it.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: I&#39;m worried about you and Mom. You really have been working too hard.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Well, I think I&#39;ve had enough of that sandwich.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: You didn&#39;t finish it.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: It&#39;s not good to eat before going to bed. A cookie can&#39;t hurt, though.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Well, I&#39;m heading off for bed and a good night&#39;s sleep.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Well, good night.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Good night, son. Good night, Dad. I&#39;m going to bed.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Good night, Philip.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Haven&#39;t you finished balancing that checkbook?</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: I found another mistake. I&#39;ll be off to bed myself in a minute.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: OK. Good night.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: I&#39;m really concerned about them, Grandpa.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: Concerned about whom?</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: About Mom and Dad. They hardly ever see each other. Dad often works late, and Mom has all these committees she&#39;s on.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: What do you propose to do about it? You have that look in your eye.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: I don&#39;t know, but there must be a way of getting them to spend more time together. Quality time.</p><h2 id="act-2" tabindex="-1">Act 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#act-2" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Act 2&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Hello there, Robbie. What are you doing up this late?</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Reading.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Reading? At this hour? Ah, come on, Robbie. What are you doing up this late?</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Things on my mind.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Do you care to talk about them?</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Sure, if you don&#39;t mind listening.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Robbie, Robbie, remember me? I&#39;m your mother. If you have something you want to talk about, I&#39;m always prepared to listen.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: You haven&#39;t been around much lately.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: So that&#39;s it. OK, let&#39;s talk.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: You and Dad are like ships that pass in the night. Dad works hard, and he works late. You work hard on all your committees, and you work late.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: I thought you were proud of the work I do.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: I am, Mom. Real proud. You are one fantastic mom, but...but I&#39;ve been noticing how little quality time you spend with Dad and me... and the family.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: It&#39;s a real problem, Robbie. I know it.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: I&#39;m concerned. There must be a way that Dad and you can spend more time together.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Well, we always talk about taking a vacation together with the family.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: I think you ought to take a vacation away from the family-alone. Kind of a second honeymoon.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: It would be wonderful, but our schedules won&#39;t allow it.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: I think I have an idea.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: You do?</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Yup. I think I have an idea that will bring Dad and you together in a more scheduled way.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: What is it?</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Well, you know how Dad is always talking about the kids in the ward and how important it is for them to be paid attention to?</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Yes.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Well...and how hard it is because the doctors and nurses are so busy?</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Yes.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Well, how would it be if you took some time to work with Dad towards solving that problem?</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: I don&#39;t get it.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Like setting up a regular weekly reading program. You and Dad. You and Dr. Philip Stewart-going to the children&#39;s ward once or twice a week and reading to them.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Not bad. Not a bad idea, Robbie. As a matter of fact, it fits right in with something I&#39;m working on right now with the school-board committee.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: What&#39;s that?</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: I&#39;ve been trying to work out a program in the public school that will bring parents and teachers together once a week to read to the students-their own children, really. By doing that, it will encourage reading.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: So it might fit in with a program for reading to the kids in the hospital.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: You&#39;re right. We&#39;ll do it! I&#39;m going to talk to Daddy about it right now.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: But Dad was so exhausted when he came home from work. Why don&#39;t you talk to him about it tomorrow?</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: You are a very smart young man, Robbie. I think I&#39;ll wait until tomorrow.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: You won&#39;t forget, will you?</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Believe me, I won&#39;t. It is a great idea, and I promise you I won&#39;t forget.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Thanks, Mom.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Thank you, Robbie.</p><h2 id="act-3" tabindex="-1">Act 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#act-3" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Act 3&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Good morning. What a wonderful morning! Don&#39;t the flowers smell wonderful?</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Good morning, Ellen. Yes, they do. That&#39;s why I&#39;m reading my paper and having my coffee on the patio this morning. Ah, it does smell sweet. How was your school-board meeting last night? You must&#39;ve come home very late.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Did you find the sandwich I made for you?</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Thanks, dear. I was so tired I didn&#39;t even finish it.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Philip, I&#39;ve been working on this special project with the school board, and I&#39;d like your opinion about it.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: What is it?</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: I&#39;ve been trying to find a way to encourage reading.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Good luck!</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Well, I think I may have found a way to do it.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Tell me about it. I work with families every day, Ellen. I see how people spend their leisure time-young and old.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Mostly watching television. Well, that would be OK if, and I repeat, if people took the time to read.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: I couldn&#39;t agree with you more.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: The question is, how do we get them to read more?</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: I think you&#39;re going to give me the answer to that question. You have that look in your eye.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: I do have an answer, Philip. Or at least I think I do.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Well, tell me about it.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: The plan is a simple one. Involve the entire family in a reading project.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: In the home?</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Yes, in the home. But first in the school-rooms.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Hmm, interesting. But how do you plan to do that?</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: By arranging with the public schools to schedule one hour a week-to start with. During that time parents are invited to attend-and to read along with the children- their children.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: It can go beyond the school system, Ellen.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Really?</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: I guarantee you it would go very well in the hospitals. My patients-mostly kids-would love to read and be read to.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: You think so?</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: I know so.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Maybe we can experiment with your patients and see how the plan works.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: I love the idea. Would you work with me?</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: I would love to, Philip.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: And that way, we&#39;ll spend more time together, Ellen. We just don&#39;t see each other anymore.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: You and I are very busy these days. This is true. We need to find time to be together more, to do things together more-you and I. This would be a wonderful way to accomplish that.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: I have a question.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Yes?</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: What do we read?</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: To the patients in the ward?</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Yes.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Well, let you and I talk about it. What would you like to read to them?</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Mrs. Stewart and I will read a poem by Robert Frost.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: It&#39;s called &quot;Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening.&quot;</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Would you begin, Ellen?</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: All right. &quot;Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening&quot; by Robert Frost. Whose woods these are I think I know. His house is in the village though; He will not see me stopping here to watch his woods fill up with snow.</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: My little horse must think it queer. To stop without a farmhouse near between the woods and frozen lake. The darkest evening of the year.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: He gives his harness bells a shake to ask if there is some mistake. The only other sound&#39;s the sweep of easy wind and downy flake.</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong> &amp; Philip: The woods are lovely, dark and deep, But I have promises to keep, And miles to go before I sleep, And miles to go before I sleep.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: You two belong on stage! That was wonderful!</p><p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Grandpa!</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Dad...Robbie. When did you come?</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: We&#39;ve been listening to you both. These are lucky kids.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: Do you enjoy reading together?</p><p><strong>Philip</strong>: Well, we may read together aloud at home.</p><p><strong>Grandpa</strong>: You were right, Robbie.</p><p><strong>Robbie</strong>: I know.</p>',129),a=[s];function i(l,p,g,h,d,u){return e(),t("div",null,a)}const w=o(r,[["render",i]]);export{b as __pageData,w as default};
