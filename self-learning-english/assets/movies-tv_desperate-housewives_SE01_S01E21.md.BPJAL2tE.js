Are you drunk?</p><p>Uh... Just a little.</p><p>H-how are you, Susie?</p><p>I’ve got... I’ve got to speak to uh... to Sophie.</p><p>It’s 1 o’clock in the morning and she is sleeping.</p><p>I’m gonna ask her to marry me.</p><p>- What? - Well, I thought I could be happy.</p><p>The restaurant is starting to make money.</p><p>I just bought a new jet ski.</p><p>My cholesterol is down.</p><p>But none of it’s any fun without her.</p><p>Oh, Morty. I just don’t think it’s going to happen.</p><p>She’s moved on. Why don’t you just sit down?</p><p>I’m gonna call you a cab.</p><p>- Sophie. - Your doctor told you not to drink.</p><p>Well, there are times when you need uh...</p><p>when you need liquid courage.</p><p>Did this ring belong to Dolores?</p><p>You gave her your dead wife’s ring?</p><p>It’s a three-carat diamond.</p><p>She shouldn’t care if it’s used.</p><p>So what... what do you say, Soph?</p><p>- All right. - Really?</p><p>- Really? - Yeah.</p><p>But no... You’ve got to do it officially. You know...</p><p>Yeah. Oh um... Here.</p><p>Sophie, would you do me the honor of marrying me?</p><p>Sophie Bremmer was still a hopeless romantic.</p><p>On one condition.</p><p>Tomorrow we trade this in for a ring of my own.</p><p>And I want a bigger diamond than Dolores got.</p><p>But she was no longer naive.</p><p>Marriage is a simple concept.</p><p>Basically, it’s a contract betwen two people that binds them together for life in the hopes that they can live happily ever after.</p><p>Sadly, some contracts... are made to be broken.</p><p>- I didn’t mess with your birth control. - Really?</p><p>Really.</p><p>Look. It’s been pulled apart and put back together.</p><p>It’s probably a manufacturing defect.</p><p>You can still see the glue marks.</p><p>I’m telling you, I didn’t do it.</p><p>Don’t insult me, Carlos.</p><p>You’ve been whining about wanting a baby for months.</p><p>Who else would it have been?</p><p>I don’t...</p><p>- Oh, no. - What?</p><p>- Mama. - Oh, Please.</p><p>It’s possible.</p><p>You buy that stuff in bulk, six months at a time, right?</p><p>Yeah. So?</p><p>Before the accident, I told her how much I wanted to have a child.</p><p>She said that she would take care of it.</p><p>I just thought that she would talk to you.</p><p>Baby, I am so sorry.</p><p>That bitch.</p><p>I can’t believe her.</p><p>I loved her but even I had issues sometimes.</p><p>She could be very controlling.</p><p>Reaching out from the grave to screw with me.</p><p>God, she’s good.</p><p>Where are you going?</p><p>I feel a wave of morning sickness coming on.</p><p>I want to be standing on your mother’s grave when it hits.</p><p>I’m gonna be home late tonight.</p><p>Peterson wants to take us out for drinks.</p><p>Oh, that’s fine. Uh...</p><p>I wanted to talk to you about something.</p><p>What?</p><p>Oh, that’s your car pool.</p><p>You gotta go. Never mind.</p><p>- Lynette, what is it? - It’s nothing.</p><p>Ok.</p><p>It’s just...</p><p>We haven’t had sex in ten days.</p><p>The longest we’ve ever gone before is nine.</p><p>Didn’t we do it last Thursday?</p><p>We started to but then... you fell asleep.</p><p>Is this why you’re so worried?</p><p>We can do it tonight if you want to.</p><p>- Whatever. - No, I’ve got ten days pent up in me.</p><p>We are doing it tonight.</p><p>You have nothing to worry about, ok?</p><p>Oh, crap. I forgot my briefcase.</p><p>Can you tell them I’ll be right there?</p><p>Sure.</p><p>Hey, Lynette.</p><p>So is Tom almost ready?</p><p>Yeah, he’s just getting his briefcase.</p><p>Sorry.</p><p>It’s ok.</p><p>- Bye. - Bye.</p><p>I got it. I got it.</p><p>Thank you for having me.</p><p>I’m gonna miss you both so much.</p><p>Us too. The house will feel just empty without you.</p><p>- Can’t you guys stay a little longer? - No, no, no.</p><p>They wanna get their new life started.</p><p>We don’t wanna hold these crazy kids back.</p><p>Bye, Morty.</p><p>Uh... Listen, I hope it’s ok but your mom told me some of the stuff that you’ve been going through, you know, with the plumber guy across the street.</p><p>- She did, huh? - Yeah. Um...</p><p>Don’t give up on him.</p><p>I mean, if I’d given up, I wouldn’t be here now with this lovely lady.</p><p>Did she tell you that he served time in prison for manslaughter?</p><p>No, she left that part out.</p><p>I don’t suppose she told you he was a drug dealer.</p><p>I don’t recall that.</p><p>Will you stop? You don’t know the whole story.</p><p>- Mother... - I told him how much you love him.</p><p>What? What were you thinking?</p><p>- What did he say? - Yeah, what did he say?</p><p>I think I walked in on him at a very bad time.</p><p>Someone close to him had just died.</p><p>Oh, god. Really?</p><p>He could use a shoulder to cry on.</p><p>Can I have one more hug? Please. I can’t stand it.</p><p>Oh, George. You have got to taste this.</p><p>- A little messy but... - I can’t wait.</p><p>Mm. Is that fennel seed? It’s fantastic.</p><p>I don’t know, but anything that good has got to be sinful.</p><p>Isn’t this fun trying different dishes and opening up to new experiences?</p><p>Rex just hates these cooks tours.</p><p>He likes to stay at home with a plate of spaghetti and a mug of root beer.</p><p>So how about this Marinara Sauce?</p><p>I think it’s the best I’ve ever had.</p><p>I had one better but that was in Italy.</p><p>You’ve been to Italy?</p><p>Rex and I took a vacation there right before the kids were born.</p><p>We had so much fun in those first few years.</p><p>Guess it was just easier to be happy back then.</p><p>I don’t know why I just said that. No more wine for me.</p><p>Maybe we should go to Italy.</p><p>- What? - Wouldn’t that be a hoot?</p><p>All those museums and cathedrals and trattorias.</p><p>We could just make pigs of ourselves.</p><p>I can’t go on a trip with you, George.</p><p>Why not?</p><p>I’m married. People would talk.</p><p>Right. I’m sorry. It was a bad idea.</p><p>Don’t worry about it.</p><p>Here. I want you to try one of these clams.</p><p>I bet they’re as good as the Marinara Sauce.</p><p>You are absolutely right.</p><p>If it’s that good, it’s just got to be sinful.</p><p>Ok, boys. It’s 7:00.</p><p>It’s time for bed. Excuse me. Let’s go.</p><p>Why do we have to go to bed so early?</p><p>I told you, honey.</p><p>Daddy and I have a special meeting tonight.</p><p>Go on.</p><p>I love you.</p><p>I’m sorry.</p><p>Hi. Whoa. All right. This is the tenth day.</p><p>Honey, give me a second to let the office wear off.</p><p>- Ok. - Ok, I’m in.</p><p>What are you thinking?</p><p>I was wondering what that smell was.</p><p>It’s probably baby drool.</p><p>There. Now you have easier access.</p><p>Incoming!</p><p>- What? - Well, that smell really soaked through, huh?</p><p>Yes. It soaked through a little.</p><p>That is the nature of baby throw-up.</p><p>Do you want me to wear a hazmat suit?</p><p>No, I just like it when you’re all clean and in your sexy clothes.</p><p>I don’t own anything clean and sexy.</p><p>Everything is either covered in baby spit or chunks of melted crayon.</p><p>Ok, I’m sorry.</p><p>You make me feel like I just got off the shrimp boat.</p><p>Honey, I said I’m sorry.</p><p>It’s just that guys sometimes like it when women, you know, put a little effort into things.</p><p>Ok. Um...</p><p>Can we just go back to the kissing thing? Can we try that.</p><p>Fine.</p><p>- Ok. Off. - Oh, the baby’s up!</p><p>Mom!</p><p>Mom!</p><p>- Susan Mayer hired you? - I know. Huh.</p><p>She decided to stop poking around in your life and call me of all people.</p><p>Lucky for you, I’ve got the biggest ad in the phone book.</p><p>- What am I going to do? - Run.</p><p>- Pack up your kid and get out of town. - That’s tricky.</p><p>My son doesn’t want to move.</p><p>He can be pretty insistent.</p><p>Well, I can throw her off the scent for a while.</p><p>Fine.</p><p>All right then.</p><p>Tell me exactly what it is you want this woman to believe.</p><p>She was born Angela, but when she was a teenager she changed her name to Mary Alice.</p><p>The application says that she was named after a relative that she no longer speaks to.</p><p>Now, here’s her birth certificate and her Utah petition for a legal name change.</p><p>What about Dana?</p><p>There was a record of another child.</p><p>A girl. Dana Marie Young, died at 18 months, apparently from some kind of fall.</p><p>It was all true. Everything he said.</p><p>How could I have been so wrong?</p><p>- I’m gonna need a check. - Oh. Of course.</p><p>Actually, before you go, I need you to check into someone else’s background.</p><p>There’s this plumber I know.</p><p>Hey. Did you get my messages?</p><p>Yeah, I didn’t want to call you back ’cause I wanted to talk to you in person.</p><p>I have some potentially upsetting news.</p><p>Come on, Mrs. Solis.</p><p>You can tell me. I can handle it.</p><p>I’m pregnant and it might be yours.</p><p>I could barely afford my new dirt bike.</p><p>How am I gonna handle child support?</p><p>We don’t know for sure if it’s yours, so relax.</p><p>- I didn’t come to watch you freak out. - Why did you come?</p><p>I want to make sure you let me protect you.</p><p>From who?</p><p>Carlos, your parents.</p><p>John, something like this can ruin your life.</p><p>That’s why you have to keep quiet about our affair.</p><p>There’s no point in this catastrophe taking both of us down.</p><p>- Thank you. - Forget about it.</p><p>- I should have worn a condom. - Yeah.</p><p>That would have been helpful.</p><p>You hired a private investigator?</p><p>I can’t trust Mike and I want to find out what really happened.</p><p>From a source that doesn’t have an agenda.</p><p>Now open it up.</p><p>Ok. You ready?</p><p>Go.</p><p>- Stop! - What?</p><p>Ok. If you find out something that’s really bad, just try to put a positive spin on it.</p><p>Ok.</p><p>I have some good news and some bad news.</p><p>Give me the bad news first.</p><p>The guy Mike killed... was a cop.</p><p>Oh, my god!</p><p>Oh, my god.</p><p>Ok. Give me the good news.</p><p>- There is none. - What?</p><p>You told me to spin it!</p><p>Oh, forget it. Just let me look at it myself.</p><p>- I can’t believe it. - What is it?</p><p>I know her.</p><p>What’s going on here?</p><p>You two just won’t stop, will you?</p><p>Deidre’s dead.</p><p>It doesn’t matter who killed her.</p><p>- Just let it go. - It’s not that easy, Kendra.</p><p>Why? My sister hated you. Both of you.</p><p>- She said so. - That was the drugs talking.</p><p>Right, right. The drugs.</p><p>Deidre humiliated this family and she threw our love back in our faces.</p><p>She knew it and she couldn’t have cared less.</p><p>- Are you done? - No.</p><p>I want to know what you’re planning.</p><p>- We’re just talking. - I don’t believe you.</p><p>Then don’t ask.</p><p>Of course I don’t want a new cardiologist but Lee’s been conducting tests for weeks.</p><p>He should have been able to know what’s wrong by now.</p><p>Honey, we socialize with them.</p><p>What am I going to say to Helen?</p><p>All I know is, I’ve never felt worse, and I’ve got to do something.</p><p>Um... I uh... I have to talk to Edie.</p><p>Um... Bree, we’re gonna be late.</p><p>Oh, it’ll just take a second. I need to um... get a recipe.</p><p>- Edie. Hi. - Hi.</p><p>I saw you at Fredo’s yesterday.</p><p>Yeah, I saw you, too.</p><p>Naughty, naughty.</p><p>- I beg your pardon? - The guy.</p><p>The one you were spoon-feeding.</p><p>Not bad. A little petit for my taste, but then again I’m not the one sleeping with him.</p><p>This is exactly what I was afraid of.</p><p>George and I are just friends.</p><p>Hey, I’m not judging you. I get it.</p><p>Rex was sticking it to that hooker housewife.</p><p>It’s payback time.</p><p>You have got the wrong idea.</p><p>That man is my pharmacist.</p><p>You could have an affair with anyone. You choosed a pharmacist?</p><p>George and I, we just talk.</p><p>He’s a very good listener and I share my hopes and dreams with him, and my innermost thoughts.</p><p>That’s all there is to it and you have to believe me.</p><p>- Ok. I believe you. - thank you.</p><p>I’m glad we cleared this up.</p><p>I know it must have looked strange and I didn’t want you to think that I was cheating on my husband.</p><p>But you sort of are.</p><p>- Excuse me? - Well, come on, bree.</p><p>You’re telling him your innermost thoughts?</p><p>Your hopes? Your dreams?</p><p>Sex aside, you’re pretty intimate with a guy that’s not your husband.</p><p>Well, I mean, everybody needs someone to talk to.</p><p>What’s wrong with talking to Rex?</p><p>We are not at home. Please leave a message.</p><p>Hello, Zach?</p><p>It’s Felicia Tillman.</p><p>I do so enjoy our little visits and I haven’t seen you for a few days.</p><p>I hope everything’s all right.</p><p>Zach’s not feeling well.</p><p>Oh. Paul.</p><p>And I don’t think it’s appropriate that he spends so much time at your house.</p><p>Made us some cocoa. How are you feeling?</p><p>I’ve felt awful for two days now.</p><p>Think I should see a doctor?</p><p>It’s probably just a touch of the flu.</p><p>We’ll keep an eye on it.</p><p>It’s this house, Zach. I feel it too.</p><p>It isn’t healthy for us to stay here.</p><p>I told you. I’m not moving.</p><p>It would be for your own good.</p><p>You can’t keep doing the kinds of things you’re doing.</p><p>Susan Mayer’s kitchen, for example.</p><p>People are going to catch on.</p><p>Wouldn’t it be great to start over somewhere in the country?</p><p>Could meet some new friends. Maybe even meet a new girl.</p><p>How about I let you sleep on it?</p><p>We’ll talk about moving tomorrow.</p><p>The lack of passion in her marriage had become an unpleasant reality for Lynette.</p><p>Then one day it occurred to her, The best way to fight reality...</p><p>was with a little fantasy.</p><p>Of course, all the fantasy in the world won’t do you any good...</p><p>if no one shows up to enjoy it.</p><p>I feel bad about putting you out like this, Tom.</p><p>You’re not putting anybody out.</p><p>You’ve been flying all day.</p><p>Why stay in some hotel?</p><p>I just hope you don’t mind sleeping on the sofa.</p><p>Yeah. Sofa should be fine.</p><p>Hey, honey. Why don’t you just...</p><p>let the maid get that?</p><p>Not funny, Tom.</p><p>Oh, by the way. Gary’s showering.</p><p>He asked if you could bring him a clean towel and your riding crop.</p><p>Come on!</p><p>No, I’m glad that you find my humiliation so entertaining.</p><p>Honey, you were wearing a French maid’s costume.</p><p>I mean, come on. What were you thinking?</p><p>I was thinking that our marriage was in trouble and one of us should try and save it.</p><p>Whoa. Since when is our marriage in trouble?</p><p>Ok, so we haven’t had sex for a few days.</p><p>Big deal. It happens.</p><p>Oh. That’s Annabel. How ironic.</p><p>How is Aannabel relevant to this conversation?</p><p>Because she comes to this house every morning to remind you of what I’m not...</p><p>what?</p><p>She’s the fantasy, Tom.</p><p>The hot woman that you work with every day with her manicured nails and her designer outfits.</p><p>I am the reality.</p><p>The wife who never wears makeup and whose clothes smell like a hamper.</p><p>Ok, this may be the stupidest thing you’ve ever said.</p><p>I used to be the fantasy.</p><p>There was a time when I didn’t need a maid’s outfit because I knew I was enough for you.</p><p>Even wearing a smelly t-shirt.</p><p>And clearly, that’s no longer the case.</p><p>Ok, honey, I don’t know what to say.</p><p>If there’s a way for me to fix this, I will do it.</p><p>Just tell me and I will do it.</p><p>No, there’s nothing to fix.</p><p>We’ve changed. That’s all I’m saying.</p><p>You ready?</p><p>You should go. You don’t want to keep Annabel waiting.</p><p>Be careful with that. You’ll give the baby heartburn.</p><p>I can’t get it hot enough.</p><p>My hormones are killing my taste buds.</p><p>You’ve been paying more attention to your food than you have to me lately.</p><p>I plan on getting really fat as a tribute to your mother.</p><p>John, what are you doing here?</p><p>I’ve been thinking about the baby.</p><p>Really? Why?</p><p>There’s a good chance that it’s mine.</p><p>I want to do the right thing.</p><p>No... Nobody expects you to do the right thing.</p><p>I kind of figured you’d try to blow me off.</p><p>That’s why I’m going directly to Mr. Solis.</p><p>What? Are you crazy? He would kill us both.</p><p>He and I need to hash this out. Man to man.</p><p>- It’s what’s best for the baby. - John!</p><p>Are you gonna go get him or am I?</p><p>Ok. You win.</p><p>Wait right here.</p><p>- Uh... Don’t get out. - why?</p><p>Because I was going to get in.</p><p>Yeah. You see, pregnant women have very strong urges.</p><p>All right.</p><p>I’m gonna freshen up and I’ll be right back.</p><p>- Ok. - You sit.</p><p>Sit. I’m turning on some music.</p><p>Um... Carlos is unavailable at the moment.</p><p>- You’re lying. - John, what are you doing?</p><p>- Mr. Solis... open up! - Stop it!</p><p>What are you... John!</p><p>- Mrs. Solis, get out of the way...- What are you doing?</p><p>No!</p><p>Oh, my god!</p><p>- Oh, god, it burns. - I’m sorry. It’s just salsa.</p><p>- It feels like acid. - I’ve been finding it so bland.</p><p>Mr. Solis! Mr. Solis! Come out here.</p><p>- I need to talk to you! - John, shut up!</p><p>John, shut the hell up. Listen to me.</p><p>You are never gonna be the father of this baby.</p><p>No matter what the paternity tests say, it’s Carlos’ child.</p><p>How can you say that?</p><p>Because Carlos can provide, John.</p><p>He will give this baby everything.</p><p>Piano lessons and summer camp and the best colleges.</p><p>He can raise this child the way a child deserves to be raised.</p><p>You can’t.</p><p>This isn’t about money.</p><p>This is about what’s best for the baby.</p><p>If you want what’s best for the baby, then you will help me.</p><p>Help me make sure this kid does not grow up poor like I did.</p><p>What’s taking you...</p><p>Oh, hey, John.</p><p>What are you doing here?</p><p>Um... He...</p><p>Justin thinks the hydrangeas need replacing.</p><p>He wanted me to come by for a second opinion.</p><p>Youre friend’s a good kid, but he’s not half the gardener you were.</p><p>You should come back and work for us.</p><p>You’re practically family.</p><p>Thanks, Mr. Solis.</p><p>Zach? Are you here?</p><p>I have to do this, dear.</p><p>I know you’ll forgive me.</p><p>- Are the boys asleep? - Tucked in tight.</p><p>- And Penny? - Sound asleep.</p><p>Ok, when this thing goes off, meet me in the bedroom.</p><p>What are you... What is this...</p><p>Uh-uh. Wait till it goes off.</p><p>All right. I’m coming in.</p><p>Oh, my god!</p><p>You want fantasy? I give you fantasy.</p><p>Come to me, woman, and prepare to be boarded.</p><p>Please, will you make it fast?</p><p>These things are just chafing.</p><p>I uh... I kinda like it.</p><p>Good. Kill the lights.</p><p>- No. - Please.</p><p>- Not turning off the lights. - Please.</p><p>No, no, no.</p><p>It’s open.</p><p>Oh, Paul, it’s you. I’m so glad.</p><p>I have some papers I want you to look at.</p><p>- Where’s my son? - Upstairs.</p><p>Sleeping off those tranquilizers you gave him.</p><p>I don’t know what you think you’re doing but I’m taking my son and going.</p><p>I am not my sister, Paul.</p><p>You do not want to screw with me.</p><p>Martha kept a journal.</p><p>Every drab event of her drab life meticulously documented.</p><p>Including her discovery that you and your wife stole a baby.</p><p>A baby named Dana.</p><p>I’m sorry if the copies are hard to read.</p><p>I hid the originals in a safe place.</p><p>It seemed like a reasonable precaution, since you murdered Martha and all.</p><p>Would you like a cookie?</p><p>Suit yourself.</p><p>Now, I have a little proposition for you.</p><p>These are the fantasies of a bored, lonely woman.</p><p>They prove nothing.</p><p>The only reason the police haven’t caught you yet is because they have no reason to suspect you.</p><p>But once they found out that Martha was blackmailing Ange, sorry, Mary Alice...</p><p>- What is it you want? - The same thing you want.</p><p>For you to leave town, change your name, and start your life over again somewhere far away from here.</p><p>If you’re so sure, why don’t you just turn me in?</p><p>Because Zach would never forgive me.</p><p>And it’s important that we be on good terms, seeing as how he’s going to be living with me now.</p><p>- What? - Your bags are packed.</p><p>You’re about to become a fugitive.</p><p>Is that the life you want for your son?</p><p>The two of you spending every night in a different town?</p><p>No. You’re a better father than that.</p><p>I can’t just leave him.</p><p>You stole him so that he could have a better life.</p><p>That was a noble act, Paul. Truly.</p><p>And it’s time for you to be noble again.</p><p>Can I at least say goodbye?</p><p>Did you allow me to say goodbye to Martha?</p><p>Oh, hi. I’m looking for Kendra Taylor.</p><p>I’m sorry. You’re gonna have to leave.</p><p>Oh. Oh, you don’t understand.</p><p>See, I can’t just drive away.</p><p>- Please get back in the car. - Look um... Bob.</p><p>- Let me try to explain. - In the car.</p><p>See, the thing is, this is maybe my last chance to find out if I can be with the man I love.</p><p>- Ma’am... - And, Bob, I can’t begin to tell you how much that means to me.</p><p>So I’m gonna walk up to that house and you’re gonna let me.</p><p>And you know why?</p><p>Because behind that badge and that just big, you-could-crush-me-like-a-fly chest, there’s a heart.</p><p>A heart that believes in love.</p><p>Just get in the damn car.</p><p>It’s not my fault you don’t have love in your life.</p><p>- Susan? - Hi, Kendra.</p><p>And despite the evidence that’s been all laid out in front of me, I can’t help thinking there’s more to the story.</p><p>- Does it sound stupid? - No, no, of course not.</p><p>Unfortunately, you’ve got the whole story right here.</p><p>But Mike’s lawyer pleaded self-defense, if that’s the case.</p><p>Delfino sold black-tar heroin to my daughter.</p><p>He killed the cop that tried to bust him, got convicted and did his time.</p><p>- End of story... - Dad...</p><p>She deserves to hear the truth, however awful.</p><p>I’m sorry, Miss Mayer. I really am.</p><p>I appreciate you talking to me.</p><p>What the hell was that?</p><p>If she knew the truth, she’d go running back to him.</p><p>She might talk him out of doing his job.</p><p>I can’t risk that.</p><p>Just don’t have the time.</p><p>Quick. Drive around the corner. We need to talk.</p><p>What do you think? Rex, I chose green so it will work whether Gabrielle has a boy or a girl.</p><p>That’s great.</p><p>What’s the matter?
